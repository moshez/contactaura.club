Adventures in the Convergence
==============================

The Convergence creates endless opportunities for adventure. Where reality bleeds and planes overlap, conventional problems gain new dimensions. Navigation becomes an expedition. Simple delivery becomes a race against shifting geography. Political conflicts play out across impossible architecture and living cities.

Types of Adventures
-------------------

Convergence Zone Exploration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most straightforward adventures involve exploring convergence zones—mapping new shortcuts, investigating unknown phenomena, or venturing into areas where convergence has recently strengthened.

**Sample Quest: Mapping the Shifted Quarter**

A district in Nexus has undergone a sudden surge in Threshold influence. Previously stable shortcuts now lead to unpredictable destinations. The Council of Cartographers hires adventurers to map the new connections, identify which are stable enough to use, and warn residents of dangerous transitions.

Challenges include navigating constantly shifting architecture, avoiding Threshold phenomena like echo chambers, dealing with Wanderers who might help or hinder, and completing the mapping before convergence shifts again and all work becomes obsolete.

Rewards might include payment from the Council, favors from grateful residents, and potentially discovering valuable new shortcuts that could be sold to merchant guilds.

**Sample Quest: The Expanding Depths**

The Spiral Depths, a living dungeon complex, has begun expanding beyond its normal boundaries. Vegetation is spreading into surrounding areas, and citizens report strange organisms emerging from the depths. Local authorities need someone to venture into the complex, discover what's causing the expansion, and either stop it or at least understand it.

This involves combat with Bloom-influenced creatures, navigation through constantly growing and shifting corridors, and possibly negotiation with Verdants who might be involved. The cause could be natural convergence strengthening, deliberate manipulation by planar natives, or something entirely unexpected.

Political Conflicts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Convergence zones are strategic resources. Wars are fought over them, alliances formed to share them, sabotage attempts made to deny them to enemies. Adventurers become involved as mercenaries, spies, diplomats, or unwitting participants.

**Sample Quest: The Iron Pass Gambit**

Two nations compete for control of the Iron Pass. One side hires adventurers to sabotage enemy shortcuts, making their fortifications worthless. The mission requires infiltrating enemy positions through Threshold connections, identifying which shortcuts are critical to their defense, and either sealing them or making them unreliable.

This combines stealth, navigation, possibly combat if discovered, and moral complexity—is disrupting shortcuts that soldiers rely on meaningfully different from conventional sabotage? What about shortcuts civilians use?

Success could shift the balance of power in the region. Failure could start a war or get the adventurers executed as spies.

**Sample Quest: The Breadbasket Succession**

The coalition governing the Breadbasket is fragmenting. Different farming families back different candidates for leadership, and foreign powers are meddling. The adventurers are hired (by whom exactly might be unclear) to investigate foreign influence, protect candidates, or gather evidence of corruption.

This involves social interaction, investigation, potentially combat with foreign agents, and navigation of complex politics where everyone has legitimate concerns and no side is clearly right. Resolution might require negotiation as much as action.

Resource Acquisition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Convergence zones produce unique resources: Bloom-grown materials, artifacts from other planes, substances created by planar interaction. Acquiring these often requires venturing into dangerous areas.

**Sample Quest: The Resonance Bloom**

A rare plant grows only in areas where Bloom and Resonance convergence overlap. It produces compounds that allow harmonic communication over vast distances, valuable for magical and commercial purposes. A wealthy patron hires adventurers to locate such a zone, harvest the plant, and return with it intact.

Challenges include finding the zone (requires understanding both Bloom and Resonance patterns), surviving whatever creatures inhabit it, and preserving the plant during transport (it might wilt outside its native convergence).

The patron's intentions might be honest research, commercial profit, or something more sinister. The plant itself might have properties beyond what was advertised.

**Sample Quest: The Calcified Archive**

In the ruins of an ancient civilization now touched by Calcified Depths convergence, documents and artifacts have been perfectly preserved for centuries. A scholar hires adventurers to retrieve specific texts from the archive.

The challenge is that the preservation extends to guardians, traps, and environmental hazards. Ancient security measures still function perfectly. Undead or constructs remain active, frozen in eternal duty. The archive itself resists change, making it difficult to remove anything.

Rescue and Recovery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

People get lost in convergence zones. Expeditions fail. Civilians wander into the Shattered Plaza and can't find their way out. Someone needs to retrieve them.

**Sample Quest: Lost in the Wandering Wood**

A noble's child, attempting to prove their courage, entered the Wandering Wood and hasn't returned. The family hires adventurers to find and retrieve them. Time is critical—the longer someone wanders the Wood, the more disoriented they become.

This requires tracking skills modified by Threshold influence (conventional tracks don't work when paths shift), understanding the Wood's pattern of responding to emotional states, and possibly negotiation with Wanderers or hermits. The child might not want to be found, adding complications.

**Sample Quest: The Shattered Plaza Expedition**

A merchant expedition entered the Shattered Plaza before the quarantine was fully established, trying to retrieve valuable goods. They haven't emerged. The city offers a substantial reward for anyone who can find and extract them.

This is essentially a rescue mission in a zone where normal navigation is impossible. Success requires understanding Threshold mechanics, possibly having Strider or Unbound characters, and dealing with whatever has trapped the expedition—might be simple disorientation or something more sinister.

Investigation and Mystery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Strange events occur in convergence zones. Determining what's happening and why often requires investigation that combines conventional detective work with understanding of planar mechanics.

**Sample Quest: The Fading Convergence**

The Hollows has begun showing signs of weakening Calcified Depths influence. Objects are aging slowly, preservation is less perfect, and residents are beginning to panic. The Council of Keepers hires adventurers to investigate the cause.

This could be natural convergence fluctuation, deliberate sabotage by someone who wants the Hollows to change, planar entities from Calcified Depths withdrawing their influence, or something entirely unexpected. Investigation requires interviewing residents, examining sites where convergence has weakened, consulting scholars, and possibly confronting whoever or whatever is responsible.

The twist: maybe the fading is natural and inevitable, and the real challenge is helping the Hollows adapt to change rather than preventing it.

**Sample Quest: The Impossible Murders**

In Nexus, people are being killed in locked rooms with no apparent means of entry or exit. Conventional investigation has failed. Someone realizes this might involve Threshold influence—the killer using shortcuts to access impossible locations.

Solving this requires understanding how shortcuts work, identifying which ones could access the murder sites, staking them out or tracking who uses them, and ultimately confronting a killer who can appear and vanish at will.

The murderer might be an Unbound, a skilled Threshold navigator, or someone with access to planar artifacts. Their motive could be personal, political, or something related to convergence itself.

Planar Diplomacy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When planar natives cross into Material reality, someone needs to negotiate with them. This often falls to adventurers with the right combination of skills and expendability.

**Sample Quest: The Verdant Expansion**

A colony of Verdants has settled in a city's park and begun expanding. They view this as simply claiming unused space for growth. City authorities view it as aggressive invasion. Neither side speaks the other's language effectively. Violence would be easy but costly.

Adventurers are hired to mediate—communicate with the Verdants (possibly through Murmurati translators), understand their needs and limitations, and negotiate a compromise that gives them space to grow without consuming the city.

This is pure negotiation and creative problem-solving. Combat would be counterproductive. Success requires understanding both Verdant nature and city politics, finding a solution both can accept.

**Sample Quest: The Wanderer's Price**

A powerful Wanderer has claimed a critical shortcut in the Iron Pass, demanding payment from anyone who wishes to use it. Both nations involved refuse to pay on principle. The shortcut is militarily critical—losing it could lose the war.

Someone needs to negotiate with the Wanderer, either convincing it to release the shortcut, determining what it really wants (which might not be monetary payment), or finding an alternative route. Understanding Threshold native psychology is essential.

Failure means war or capitulation. Success might create a precedent for how Material beings and planar natives can coexist.

Campaign Frameworks
-------------------

Different campaign structures work well in the Convergence setting:

Urban Politics Campaign
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set the campaign in a single border city like Nexus or Verdant Reach. Adventures involve local politics, guild conflicts, managing convergence phenomena, and dealing with various factions competing for influence.

This framework emphasizes social interaction, investigation, and understanding complex relationships. Combat happens but isn't the primary focus. Characters become increasingly entangled in city politics, making alliances and enemies.

Exploration Campaign
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Focus on exploring unknown or poorly mapped convergence zones. Characters are hired by cartographers, scholars, or governments to venture into dangerous areas, map them, and return with information and resources.

This emphasizes navigation, survival, and dealing with environmental hazards. Combat with creatures and planar natives is common. Social interaction happens primarily with fellow explorers and patrons.

Military Campaign
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set during a war for control of strategic convergence zones. Characters are soldiers, mercenaries, or specialists employed by military forces. Adventures involve reconnaissance, sabotage, securing strategic positions, and major battles.

This emphasizes tactical combat, navigation under pressure, and moral complexity of warfare. Characters must balance following orders with personal ethics, especially when missions involve civilian areas or questionable tactics.

Merchant Campaign
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Characters operate a trading company specializing in convergence-enabled commerce. Adventures involve securing new trade routes, negotiating with planar natives for exotic goods, defending shipments from rivals, and adapting to shifting convergence patterns.

This combines commerce, politics, exploration, and occasional combat. Success requires understanding both planar mechanics and economics. Characters build a business empire while navigating the chaos of convergent reality.

Long-Term Threats
-----------------

Beyond individual adventures, certain threats can drive entire campaigns:

Convergence Catastrophe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What if convergence in a major city suddenly strengthens to unprecedented levels? Multiple planes overlap simultaneously, reality becomes fluid, and the city begins transforming into something alien. Can it be reversed? Should it be? What happens to residents who've been changed by the surge?

This creates an escalating crisis where the environment itself is the threat. Early adventures involve evacuating civilians and securing critical infrastructure. Middle phase deals with understanding what's happening. Late phase requires deciding whether to restore the city or accept its transformation.

Planar Invasion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Planar natives have generally crossed into Material reality in small numbers, as individuals or small groups. What if that changed? What if Wanderers began arriving in vast numbers, claiming entire cities as transitional spaces? Or Verdants decided the Material Plane needed to be covered in vegetation for its own good?

This creates a conflict between Material civilization and planar entities with fundamentally different values. It's not simple good vs. evil—the planar natives have legitimate perspectives. But coexistence might not be possible without major compromises on both sides.

Convergence Weapon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Someone has developed the ability to artificially manipulate convergence strength. They can strengthen it, making areas chaotic and valuable. They can weaken it, destroying cities' economic foundations. They might demand political concessions, wealth, or power. Or they might simply use this ability with incomprehensible motives.

This creates a hunt for the weapon and its wielder, combined with dealing with the chaos they've already caused. It raises questions about whether convergence should be controlled, who has that right, and what the consequences might be.

Fading Convergence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Convergence globally is weakening. Shortcuts are failing. Growth is slowing. Planar natives are disappearing. Cities built entirely around convergence economics face collapse. The whole structure of civilization is threatened.

This creates an investigation into why it's happening, attempts to reverse it, and difficult decisions about how to adapt to a world where convergence might vanish entirely. Do you fight to preserve the status quo? Help society transition? Try to speed the process? Each choice has profound consequences.

Adventure Design Principles
----------------------------

When creating adventures in the Convergence:

**Leverage Planar Properties**
   Don't just use convergence as set dressing. Make it mechanically relevant. Design encounters that require understanding shortcuts, managing aggressive growth, or dealing with planar-native psychology.

**Embrace Uncertainty**
   Maps that update daily, strategies that depend on unstable shortcuts, plans that must account for shifting convergence—these create tension and force improvisation.

**Mix Challenge Types**
   Pure combat gets boring. Mix in navigation challenges, social encounters, investigation, and creative problem-solving. The Convergence supports all of these.

**Create Moral Complexity**
   Few situations have clear right answers. Border cities face real problems—food security, trade routes, plague defense—that convergence helps solve. Disrupting it has consequences. Controlling it has costs. Let players wrestle with these tradeoffs.

**Reward Understanding**
   Players who study planar mechanics, understand convergence patterns, and learn to work with rather than against reality's fluidity should have advantages. Knowledge is power in a world where understanding determines navigation.

The Convergence provides endless opportunities for stories where reality itself is negotiable, where understanding trumps force, and where the distinction between natural and supernatural dissolves entirely.
