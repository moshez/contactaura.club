Species of the Convergence
==========================

The peoples of the Convergence are as diverse as the planes that shape them. Some species emerged in convergence zones, their very nature reflecting planar influence. Others evolved in conventional environments but have learned to thrive where reality bleeds. Each brings unique perspectives, abilities, and challenges to life in a world where boundaries between planes are negotiable.

Humans
------

**Origin:** Material Plane natives
**Population:** Most numerous in non-convergent and weak convergence zones
**Characteristics:** Adaptable, varied, ambitious

Humans are the baseline, the standard against which other species are measured. They evolved on the Material Plane before convergence became widespread, developing in environments where physical laws remained consistent. This origin shapes their nature—they expect stability, plan for predictable futures, and struggle when reality refuses to cooperate.

Yet paradoxically, this struggle makes them adaptable. Humans cannot navigate the Wandering Wood by instinct like Striders can, so they develop maps and hire guides. They cannot perceive convergence strength naturally like the Faceted, so they build instruments and study patterns. They cannot exist comfortably in strong convergence zones like the Unbound, so they construct careful architectures and establish protocols.

This adaptability through ingenuity means humans are found everywhere, even in environments that should be hostile to them. They cluster in border cities, managing chaos through organization. They establish outposts in dangerous convergence zones, protected by prepared defenses. They explore unknown areas, mapping what should be unmappable.

Humans hold most positions of political power, not through any inherent superiority but through sheer numbers and organizational capacity. They built the major cities, established the trade networks, wrote the legal codes. Other species operate within these human-created frameworks or exist in parallel to them.

**Typical Backgrounds:** Merchants, soldiers, scholars, farmers, craftspeople—the full range of occupations
**Relationship with Convergence:** Cautious respect; they benefit from it but rarely fully comfortable with it
**Roleplaying Notes:** Humans can be anything, represent any philosophy. They're the generalists in a world of specialists.

The Striders
------------

**Origin:** Threshold-touched, possibly originally human
**Population:** Scattered throughout Threshold-influenced zones
**Characteristics:** Tall, multi-jointed, naturally attuned to spatial connections

Striders stand seven to eight feet tall, their frames elongated in ways that seem almost insectile. Their joints bend at angles that conventional anatomy would not allow—knees that flex both directions, elbows with full rotational freedom, spines that curve and straighten independently of torso orientation. They move with fluid grace that looks alien to human eyes, their gaits adapted to navigating spaces where conventional physics don't apply.

Their most striking feature is their intuitive understanding of connections. Striders can sense shortcuts, feel the thinness of planar boundaries, perceive relationships between distant points. Place a Strider in the Shattered Plaza and where a human would become hopelessly lost, they'd navigate by feel, choosing doorways based on instinctive understanding rather than visual cues.

This ability makes Striders invaluable as guides, navigators, and scouts in Threshold zones. They're the ones who discover new shortcuts, who map routes through impossible architecture, who can lead expeditions through areas where conventional navigation fails. Cities like Nexus employ Striders extensively, paying well for their services.

But their attunement to connection comes with costs. Striders struggle with isolation. Being alone—truly alone, without anyone or anything to connect to—causes them deep psychological distress. They cluster in communities, maintain constant social bonds, and rarely venture into unpopulated areas. A Strider forced into solitary confinement would likely go mad within days.

Their culture emphasizes relationships, networks, and webs of obligation. Status among Striders isn't measured by wealth or power but by the number and quality of connections maintained. A well-connected Strider can call on favors across vast distances, accessing resources through elaborate social networks.

Striders reproduce slowly, their biology apparently influenced by Threshold nature. They don't have traditional family structures—instead, children are raised communally, forming bonds with entire communities rather than specific parents. This makes their population growth sluggish but ensures strong social cohesion.

**Typical Backgrounds:** Navigators, guides, message couriers, social connectors, diplomats
**Relationship with Convergence:** Natural affinity for Threshold influence, discomfort in non-convergent zones
**Roleplaying Notes:** Emphasize social bonds, intuitive spatial understanding, discomfort with isolation

The Faceted
-----------

**Origin:** Unknown, possibly from a plane of crystalline structure
**Population:** Moderate, concentrated in border cities
**Characteristics:** Crystalline skin, fragmented perception, able to perceive planar boundaries

The Faceted appear almost human in basic structure—same height range, same general proportions—but their skin is their defining feature. It resembles polished crystal or gemstone, faceted in complex geometric patterns that catch and refract light. Each individual's pattern is unique, creating rainbow effects that shift with movement.

This crystalline nature isn't merely cosmetic. The Faceted perceive reality differently than other species. They see in facets—multiple perspectives simultaneously, each showing a slightly different aspect of the same scene. This fragmented perception allows them to notice things others miss, to see convergence boundaries that should be invisible, to detect subtle shifts in planar influence.

In practical terms, the Faceted are extraordinary observers. They can identify convergence strength at a glance, predict when shortcuts will shift, notice planar natives disguising themselves as Material beings. This makes them invaluable as scouts, security consultants, and convergence scholars. Cities employ Faceted inspectors to monitor convergence zones, providing early warning of dangerous fluctuations.

Their fragmented perception also affects how they think. The Faceted rarely commit to single conclusions. They see multiple possibilities, multiple truths, and tend toward philosophical positions that embrace paradox and contradiction. They're simultaneously optimists and pessimists, believers and skeptics, because they perceive multiple valid perspectives on any question.

This makes them frustrating negotiators but excellent mediators. They can understand all sides of a conflict genuinely, not through empathy but through direct perception of multiple viewpoints. Diplomatic corps often include Faceted members for this reason.

Physically, the Faceted are more fragile than humans. Their crystalline skin, while beautiful, is brittle. They bruise and crack more easily than flesh. But they also heal differently—damaged areas slowly regrow in new patterns, creating permanent records of injury. Elderly Faceted carry elaborate histories written in their skin's geometric variations.

Their culture values observation, documentation, and multi-perspective analysis. Faceted scholarship tends toward exhaustive documentation of all possible interpretations rather than commitment to single theories. Their art emphasizes prismatic effects, works designed to be viewed from multiple angles simultaneously.

**Typical Backgrounds:** Scholars, observers, mediators, security inspectors, artists
**Relationship with Convergence:** Natural ability to perceive it, comfortable in any convergence strength
**Roleplaying Notes:** See multiple perspectives, notice details others miss, avoid absolute statements

The Murmurati
-------------

**Origin:** Possibly Bloom-touched, possibly entirely separate plane
**Population:** Sparse, found primarily in Bloom zones and underwater environments
**Characteristics:** Harmonic communication, gentle bioluminescence, fluid movement

The Murmurati are humanoid in the loosest sense—bipedal, roughly human-sized, with faces and hands—but their soft, translucent skin and graceful movements give them an aquatic quality. They communicate through harmonics, producing complex tones and overtones that convey meaning more precisely than words. Their skin glows softly with bioluminescence that shifts in color and pattern with emotional state.

To human ears, Murmurati speech sounds like singing, humming, or chiming. It carries emotional content directly—they cannot lie convincingly because their harmonics betray true feelings. This makes them extraordinarily trustworthy in negotiations and contracts, as deception is essentially impossible for them.

But it also makes linguistic communication with other species challenging. Murmurati must learn to produce conventional speech sounds, which requires training and conscious effort. Most speak halting, melodic versions of common languages, their harmonic nature bleeding through. Conversely, other species learning to understand Murmurati harmonics must develop musical training.

Their bioluminescence serves multiple purposes: communication, emotional expression, and navigation in dark environments. Complex feelings produce elaborate light displays. A Murmurati in love glows in soft, pulsing patterns; one in distress flashes in rapid, sharp bursts. They're terrible at hiding emotions.

Murmurati are naturally comfortable in Bloom zones. The constant growth and vitality resonates with something in their nature. They take jobs as Shapers in living cities, tending architectural vegetation with instinctive understanding. They serve as healers, their harmonics apparently soothing pain and promoting recovery.

They're also found in underwater environments, able to hold their breath for extended periods and move with surprising grace in water. Some scholars theorize they originated in an aquatic plane; others suggest Bloom influence simply adapts them to wherever life flourishes.

Culturally, the Murmurati value harmony—literal and metaphorical. They build consensus-based societies where decisions are made through extended harmonic discussions, each voice blending into an overall pattern. This process is beautiful but slow, requiring patience other species struggle to maintain.

They reproduce by budding—small lumps that develop on their skin, growing over months into infant Murmurati before detaching. This process is considered deeply private, and discussing it openly is taboo in their culture.

**Typical Backgrounds:** Healers, Shapers, mediators, musicians, underwater workers
**Relationship with Convergence:** Affinity for Bloom zones, comfortable underwater
**Roleplaying Notes:** Communicate harmonically, display emotions luminously, value consensus and harmony

The Unbound
-----------

**Origin:** Threshold natives who have adapted to Material existence
**Population:** Small, concentrated in strong Threshold zones
**Characteristics:** Partially intangible, flickering between solid and gaseous states, exist in states of transition

The Unbound are perhaps the most alien species commonly encountered in convergence zones. They exist in a state of constant transition between solid and gaseous forms, their bodies flickering, shifting, never quite settling into complete materiality. At any given moment, an Unbound individual is simultaneously solid enough to interact with physical objects and ephemeral enough to drift through walls.

This state makes them extraordinarily difficult to describe or depict. They have forms—generally humanoid, with faces and limbs—but these forms are suggestions rather than fixed structures. Clothing and equipment must be specially treated to shift states along with them, or it simply falls through as they become gaseous.

The Unbound navigate Threshold-influenced environments with ease that surpasses even Striders. They can sense shortcuts not just intellectually but physically, their partially intangible nature allowing them to perceive the thinness of planar boundaries directly. They sometimes simply drift through walls rather than bothering with doors, their bodies finding paths through spaces that shouldn't exist.

This makes them unparalleled spies, scouts, and infiltrators. An Unbound can enter almost anywhere, pass through barriers, and observe without being detected (though their flickering nature means they're not truly invisible, just hard to focus on). Security forces in major cities monitor for Unbound presence carefully.

But their transitional nature is also limiting. The Unbound struggle in areas without Threshold influence. In non-convergent zones, they can maintain solid form only with great effort and constant concentration. Extended time away from Threshold energy leaves them exhausted, their forms dissipating into near-imperceptibility.

They also struggle with permanence in all forms. Forming lasting relationships is difficult when you might literally drift apart. Creating enduring works is challenging when your own nature is temporary. Unbound culture, such as it is, emphasizes the present moment, immediate experience, and acceptance of impermanence.

Most Unbound encountered in Material cities are temporary visitors, passing through on incomprehensible errands. Those who stay longer often work as couriers, spies, or explorers—professions that value their unique abilities and don't require permanence.

They communicate through a combination of words and what they call "state shifts"—deliberate changes in their solidity, form, and position that convey meaning. Other species can learn to read basic state shifts, but the full complexity remains essentially opaque.

Reproduction among the Unbound is barely understood by outsiders. They seem to occasionally split, one individual becoming two, but whether this is reproduction, mitosis, or something else entirely is unclear.

**Typical Backgrounds:** Couriers, spies, scouts, explorers, temporary workers
**Relationship with Convergence:** Require strong Threshold influence to thrive
**Roleplaying Notes:** Exist in transition, comfortable with impermanence, struggle with solid/stable environments

Planar Natives
--------------

Beyond the primary species, convergence zones occasionally host true planar natives—beings from the Threshold or Bloom who have crossed into Material reality.

Wanderers (Threshold Natives)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Entities of pure transition, Wanderers exist as movement rather than position. They appear as constantly shifting figures that never settle into fixed form—now tall, now short, now vaguely humanoid, now abstract. They communicate through changes in their shifting patterns, a language of transformation that few Material beings ever fully grasp.

Wanderers trade information, shortcuts, and guidance. They collect "moments of fixity"—objects, memories, or experiences of permanence—as humans might collect coins. Why they value these is unclear, but they'll exchange valuable knowledge for particularly interesting fixed objects.

Verdants (Bloom Natives)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Beings of living plant matter, Verdants constantly bud off parts of themselves that grow into independent entities before reabsorbing. They exist in states of continuous multiplication, their bodies indistinct from surrounding vegetation. A Verdant might be a single tree-like entity or a colony of interconnected plants—the distinction is unclear even to them.

Verdants trade Bloom-grown goods and agricultural knowledge. They sometimes settle in Material cities with strong Bloom influence, tending gardens and managing growth spirals. They're generally peaceful unless their growth is threatened, at which point they can become aggressive defenders of their right to proliferate.

Interspecies Relations
-----------------------

The various species interact in complex ways:

**Humans and Striders** generally cooperate well. Humans provide stable organizational frameworks; Striders provide navigation through chaos. This practical synergy creates comfortable working relationships.

**Humans and Faceted** have more friction. The Faceted tendency to see all perspectives frustrates human desire for clear answers and decisive action. But their abilities are valuable enough that humans tolerate philosophical differences.

**Humans and Murmurati** relate through mutual incomprehension that somehow works. The Murmurati's absolute honesty is alien to human political culture, but their trustworthiness makes them valued partners in critical negotiations.

**Humans and Unbound** maintain careful distance. The Unbound's flickering nature and comfort with impermanence unsettles humans, who value solid ground and lasting institutions.

Among non-human species, relationships vary. Striders and Faceted often work together, combining spatial intuition with perceptive ability. Murmurati and Unbound rarely interact, their natures too different. Faceted and Murmurati sometimes collaborate, though harmonic communication and multi-perspective vision create interesting translation challenges.

Playing Different Species
--------------------------

Each species offers different roleplaying opportunities:

**Humans:** Play humans when you want flexibility, familiarity, and adaptability. They can be anything, represent any philosophy or approach.

**Striders:** Play Striders when you want to emphasize relationships, social networks, and spatial intuition. They excel in navigator and diplomat roles.

**Faceted:** Play Faceted when you want to notice details, perceive hidden truths, and embrace multiple perspectives simultaneously. They excel as observers and analysts.

**Murmurati:** Play Murmurati when you want to emphasize honesty, emotional expression, and harmony. They excel as healers and mediators.

**Unbound:** Play Unbound when you want to exist on the edges, comfortable with impermanence and transition. They excel as scouts and spies.

Each species sees the Convergence differently, offering unique perspectives on the same strange world.
