The Threshold
-------------

Nature and Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Threshold is not a place in any conventional sense. It is a space between spaces, a plane of pure connection and transition. Imagine an infinite library of doorways, each leading somewhere else, none occupying a fixed position. The Threshold has no native geography, no landmarks, no distances. There is only proximity—not in space, but in conceptual connection.

In its pure form, the Threshold appears as an endless labyrinth of passages, doors, archways, and corridors. None of these remain stable. A door that led to one destination moments ago now opens to another. Corridors that seemed parallel intersect impossibly. Architecture that should not function—stairs that climb to their own base, halls that contain themselves—is commonplace and unremarkable.

The Threshold operates on a simple principle: **connection transcends distance.** Two points are "near" in the Threshold not because they occupy adjacent space, but because they are conceptually linked. A library and a bookshop are neighbors in the Threshold, even if an ocean separates them in the Material. A castle's throne room connects directly to its dungeons, the intervening floors irrelevant.

This makes navigation purely a matter of understanding relationships. Distance means nothing. Direction is irrelevant. Only connection matters.

Threshold Influence on the Material
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Where the Threshold converges with the Material Plane, these properties bleed through:

**Spatial Shortcuts**
   Buildings develop unexpected connections. A door in the east wing might open to the west tower. Servants' passages connect kitchens to nobles' quarters three floors up. Shortcuts appear overnight—a corridor that wasn't there yesterday now links two previously distant chambers.

**Easier Teleportation**
   Magic that moves creatures or objects across space becomes more reliable and less costly in Threshold zones. Spells that normally require significant power work with minimal effort. Even those without magical training sometimes inadvertently teleport short distances when under stress.

**Impossible Architecture**
   Buildings influenced by the Threshold don't obey normal geometric rules. Halls form closed loops that should be impossible. Rooms are larger inside than outside. Structures contain more floors than their exterior suggests. Architects working in strong Threshold zones either learn to embrace this or go mad trying to maintain conventional design.

**Wandering Paths**
   Roads and corridors affected by the Threshold shift their destinations. A path walked yesterday leads somewhere entirely different today. Travelers report setting out for the market and arriving instead at the docks. Most border cities post daily route updates, and experienced residents learn to specify their destination clearly when entering a doorway.

**Planar Natives**
   The Threshold has no native life in the conventional sense, but it has inhabitants: entities of pure transition, beings that exist as movement rather than position. These **Wanderers** appear as constantly shifting figures, never quite settling into a fixed form. Some serve as guides through Threshold-touched areas, able to navigate the shifting connections instinctively. Others are simply travelers, moving endlessly through all possible doorways for reasons incomprehensible to Material beings.

Threshold Phenomena
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Resonance Points**
   Certain locations develop strong connections to distant places. These resonance points become reliable shortcuts—assuming one can afford the toll. Many are controlled by merchant guilds or noble houses, who charge handsomely for passage through their personal portals.

**Echo Chambers**
   Rooms that connect to themselves in impossible loops. Travelers enter, find themselves passing through the same space repeatedly, and must understand the correct "exit thought" to escape. These sometimes form accidentally in strong convergence zones, trapping unwary explorers.

**Threshold Storms**
   Rare but dangerous events where connections multiply uncontrollably. During a storm, every door leads somewhere random, changing moment to moment. Buildings fold in on themselves. Travelers find themselves emerging from locations they never entered. The only safety is to stay still and wait for the storm to pass.

The Bloom
---------

Nature and Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Bloom is life without limit, growth without end. It is a plane where every seed becomes a forest, every creature spawns a multitude, and nothing ever stops expanding. There is no death in the Bloom, only endless proliferation. Resources are infinite because everything reproduces faster than it can be consumed.

In its pure form, the Bloom is a chaotic tangle of vegetation and flesh, where plants and animals grow into and through each other in a riot of uncontrolled fecundity. There is no stable ground—everything is organic matter, constantly growing, shifting, consuming space. Light barely penetrates the canopy of infinite trees. Movement is possible only by cutting through growth that regenerates within hours.

The Bloom operates on a single principle: **all life proliferates endlessly.** Reproduction, healing, and growth occur at accelerated rates. Damage to living matter is repaired almost instantaneously. Seeds germinate and mature within days. Creatures reproduce in vast numbers, their offspring immediately beginning the cycle anew.

But this is not benevolent. The Bloom does not distinguish between wanted and unwanted growth. A healing wound will continue healing, flesh expanding beyond its original bounds. A planted crop will spread aggressively, choking out all other plants. Life in the Bloom is not sustainable—it is expansionist, consuming all available space until nothing remains but a seething mass of organic matter.

Bloom Influence on the Material
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Where the Bloom converges with the Material Plane, growth accelerates dramatically:

**Explosive Agriculture**
   Farms in Bloom-touched regions produce multiple harvests per year. Seeds planted at dawn bear fruit by dusk. Orchards that should take decades to mature are productive within months. This makes Bloom zones incredibly valuable for feeding populations, but farmers must constantly manage growth to prevent crops from overwhelming their fields.

**Rapid Healing**
   Wounds close in hours instead of days. Broken bones mend in weeks instead of months. Diseases that would be fatal elsewhere can be survived with proper care. Hospitals and healing houses in Bloom zones save countless lives, but healers must be careful—healing magic or Bloom influence pushed too far can cause tissue to grow beyond normal bounds, creating tumors or deformities.

**Architectural Vegetation**
   Buildings in Bloom-influenced areas require constant maintenance. Vines grow overnight, engulfing walls. Moss spreads across roofs with unnatural speed. Wood used in construction may sprout new growth. Many structures in strong Bloom zones simply embrace this, integrating living vegetation into their design. Entire buildings become symbiotic organisms, grown as much as built.

**Verdant Barriers**
   Unchecked growth creates natural walls and obstacles. Districts can become isolated if vegetation isn't pruned regularly. Roads disappear beneath aggressive plants. Abandoned areas turn to jungle within weeks. Cities employ specialized pruners—often adventurers who can handle the dangers that Bloom-influenced plants sometimes develop.

**Planar Natives**
   The Bloom's inhabitants are creatures of endless multiplication. **Verdants** are beings of living plant matter, constantly budding off parts of themselves that grow into independent entities before reabsorbing. They are difficult to truly kill, as any fragment can regenerate into a full creature given time and favorable conditions. Most are peaceful, trading Bloom-grown goods, but some view Material space as simply more room for expansion.

Bloom Phenomena
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Growth Spirals**
   Areas where Bloom influence intensifies in a feedback loop. A plant grows, creating more organic matter, which attracts more Bloom energy, causing more growth. These can consume entire districts if not caught early. Cities with strong Bloom influence maintain "pruner guilds" dedicated to identifying and cutting back growth spirals before they become uncontrollable.

**Fecundity Fields**
   Zones of such intense Bloom influence that non-organic matter begins to "grow." Stone develops moss-like patterns that spread and thicken. Metal oxidizes and expands. Water becomes cloudy with microorganisms. These fields are usually temporary but can render areas uninhabitable for months.

**Living Dungeons**
   Ancient structures touched by the Bloom don't just decay—they transform. Corridors become lined with pulsing organic matter. Rooms develop membranous walls that react to intrusion. Traps grow and adapt. These dungeons are both treacherous and valuable, as Bloom-influenced organisms often produce substances impossible to create otherwise.

Other Planes
------------

While the Threshold and the Bloom dominate, they are not the only planes that touch the Material:

**The Calcified Depths**
   A plane of eternal stasis and perfect preservation. Where it converges, time slows, decay halts, and change becomes difficult. Rare and usually weak, but valued for its ability to preserve perishable goods indefinitely.

**The Resonance**
   A plane of pure vibration and sound. Its influence causes objects to hum with harmonic frequencies, enables communication across vast distances, and sometimes drives creatures mad with incessant noise.

**The Penumbra**
   A plane of shadow and obscurity. Its touch makes areas darker, harder to perceive, and difficult to remember clearly. Useful for those who value secrecy, dangerous for those who wander in unprepared.

These minor planes create localized phenomena and are valuable for specialized purposes, but they lack the widespread, transformative impact of the Threshold and Bloom.

Planar Interaction
------------------

Where multiple planes converge simultaneously, their influences don't simply add—they interact in complex ways:

- A location touched by both Threshold and Bloom might have buildings that grow like plants **and** rearrange their rooms, creating living architecture in constantly shifting configurations.

- Threshold and Calcified Depths together could create a space where connections exist but never change—permanent, stable shortcuts.

- Bloom and Resonance might produce plants that sing, communicating through harmonic growth patterns.

These multi-planar convergences are rare but create the most valuable and dangerous locations in the setting. Entire cities can be built around them, and nations go to war for their control.

Understanding planar properties and their interactions is essential knowledge for anyone navigating the Convergence. What seems like chaos follows patterns, once you learn to see them.
