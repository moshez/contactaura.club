Setting Overview

The Nature of Convergence
--------------------------

The Material Plane is not alone. It exists alongside countless other planes of existence, each with its own nature and laws. Most of the time, these planes remain separate, their boundaries intact. But in certain places, at certain times, the barriers thin. The planes overlap. Reality bleeds.

This is the Convergence.

Where convergence occurs, the laws of different planes intermingle. A doorway in a border city might lead not to the next room, but to a street three miles distant. A garden touched by the Bloom grows with such vigor that buildings must be pruned weekly lest vines consume them entirely. A dungeon influenced by the Threshold rearranges its rooms like a shuffled deck of cards, its geometry refusing to remain fixed.

Convergence is not uniform. It waxes and wanes over years or decades, making some regions newly valuable—or newly dangerous. A city that stands at a strong convergence point commands trade routes and resources. A valley where convergence has faded becomes an ordinary place, its strange bounty diminished. Nations rise and fall on the strength of their convergence zones.

The Primary Planes
-------------------

While many planes brush against the Material, two dominate the Convergence: the Threshold and the Bloom.

**The Threshold** is a plane of infinite doorways and passages, a transitive realm where distance means nothing and connection is everything. Where it converges with the Material Plane, space itself becomes malleable. Teleportation grows easier. Architecture develops impossible geometries. Travelers step through an ordinary door and emerge somewhere entirely different. The Threshold cares nothing for distance—only for connection.

**The Bloom** is a plane of endless, unstoppable growth. All organic matter proliferates continuously, each plant and creature multiplying and expanding without limit. Where it touches the Material, agriculture becomes explosive. Wounds heal with unnatural speed. But growth does not stop when desired—buildings must be constantly pruned against encroaching vines, and unchecked vegetation can consume entire districts if left untended.

These two planes, more than any others, shape life in the Convergence. Their influences are opposite yet complementary: the Threshold connects, while the Bloom multiplies. Together, they create a world of opportunity and chaos.

Life in a Convergent World
---------------------------

For most people, the Convergence is simply part of life. Farmers in Bloom-touched valleys harvest three crops a year and sell the surplus to distant cities. Merchants in Threshold-influenced border towns grow rich on trade that bypasses normal geography. Guards patrol districts where doorways sometimes lead to unexpected places. Healers in strong Bloom zones can save patients who would die elsewhere.

But the Convergence also brings danger. Planar natives—beings from the Threshold and Bloom—sometimes cross into the Material. Most are simply travelers or traders, but some are threats. A Threshold entity might view Material buildings as a canvas for impossible architecture, caring nothing for the inhabitants. A Bloom creature might seed aggressive vegetation that chokes entire neighborhoods.

And then there is politics. Control of a convergence zone means control of resources. A Threshold-rich city controls trade routes, able to move goods instantaneously across vast distances. A Bloom-influenced region controls food supply, feeding cities that would otherwise starve. Wars are fought over convergence points. Alliances shift as convergence strength waxes and wanes. Borders are drawn not by rivers or mountains, but by the invisible lines where planar influence begins and ends.

Adventurers in the Convergence
-------------------------------

For those willing to brave the strange and dangerous, the Convergence offers endless opportunities. Dungeons don't simply sit unchanged—they shift and grow, their Threshold-touched sections rearranging daily while their Bloom-infested levels expand with living architecture. Ancient ruins might hold doors to places thought unreachable. Merchants pay well for guides who can navigate the shifting paths of strong convergence zones.

But adventuring here requires adaptation. Standard maps fail in Threshold-influenced dungeons. Normal tactics falter when the environment actively grows to impede you. Magic works differently near strong convergence, bending to planar influence in ways that can surprise even experienced casters.

The rewards, though, are substantial. Artifacts from other planes, resources impossible to find elsewhere, knowledge of how reality itself can be shaped. Those who master the Convergence become invaluable—to rulers who need convergence zones secured, to scholars studying planar mechanics, to merchants seeking new trade routes.

This is a world where reality itself is negotiable, where the impossible becomes routine, and where understanding the interplay of planes can mean the difference between wealth and ruin, safety and disaster.

Welcome to the Convergence.
