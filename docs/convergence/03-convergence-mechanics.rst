Convergence Mechanics
=====================

Understanding Convergence Strength
-----------------------------------

Convergence is not binary—it exists on a spectrum. Some locations experience faint touches of planar influence, barely noticeable except to trained observers. Others stand at the intersection of multiple planes, reality itself warped by their overlapping presence.

Scholars classify convergence into three broad categories:

**Weak Convergence**
   Subtle planar influence that creates minor, localized effects. A forest where paths sometimes shift. A valley where crops grow slightly faster than normal. A cave system where the air feels thin and reality seems brittle. These areas are common and usually safe, though they can still harbor surprises.

**Moderate Convergence**
   Noticeable planar influence that shapes daily life. Buildings develop shortcuts. Agriculture becomes notably more productive. Magic behaves unpredictably. These zones are valuable enough to fight over but stable enough to inhabit. Most border cities exist at moderate convergence.

**Strong Convergence**
   Overwhelming planar influence where multiple planes overlap simultaneously. Architecture defies geometry. Growth spirals consume entire districts overnight. Teleportation becomes almost trivial. Reality feels negotiable. Strong convergence zones are incredibly valuable, incredibly dangerous, and the source of most political conflict.

Measuring convergence precisely is more art than science. Scholars use various indicators—the reliability of shortcuts, the speed of plant growth, the frequency of planar native sightings—but no single metric captures the full complexity. Experienced convergence navigators develop intuition for it, feeling when reality has grown thin.

Convergence Cycles
------------------

Convergence is not static. It waxes and wanes over time, following patterns that scholars have observed but cannot fully predict.

Temporal Cycles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Seasonal Variation**
   Most convergence zones show minor fluctuations with the seasons. Threshold influence often peaks in autumn and winter when travel patterns change. Bloom influence surges in spring and summer when growth is naturally most vigorous. These seasonal shifts are predictable and factored into agricultural and trade planning.

**Decadal Shifts**
   Over decades, convergence zones can strengthen or weaken significantly. A border city might experience a surge in Threshold influence, transforming from moderate to strong convergence over twenty years. This creates booms in trade and population. Conversely, a Bloom-touched valley might see its influence fade, forcing farmers to adapt to normal yields or relocate.

**Century-Scale Transformations**
   The longest-observed cycles span multiple human lifetimes. Historical records show that regions can transition from no convergence to strong convergence and back over centuries. Ancient ruins often mark places where convergence was once strong but has since faded entirely. Scholars speculate about what drives these long cycles but have yet to develop a complete theory.

Geographic Patterns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Convergence doesn't shift randomly across the landscape. It follows certain tendencies:

**Ley Lines**
   Lines of particularly thin planar boundaries crisscross the world. Convergence tends to be stronger along these lines and especially intense where they intersect. Cities built at ley line junctions often become major power centers.

**Planar Anchors**
   Certain locations seem to attract or stabilize convergence. Ancient stone circles, natural caverns of unusual geometry, sites of historical significance—these places maintain convergence strength even as surrounding areas fluctuate. Many civilizations build their capitals around planar anchors.

**Resonance Cascades**
   When convergence strengthens in one location, nearby areas sometimes experience sympathetic increases. This creates "convergence zones" where an entire region shares similar planar influence. The boundaries of these zones can shift, expand, or contract, redrawing strategic maps.

Signs of Changing Convergence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Those who live in or near convergence zones learn to read the signs:

**Threshold Strengthening:**
   - Existing shortcuts become more reliable
   - New doorways begin leading to unexpected places
   - Buildings develop additional impossible architecture
   - Planar native sightings increase
   - Navigation becomes less predictable

**Threshold Weakening:**
   - Shortcuts work inconsistently or fail entirely
   - Impossible architecture slowly normalizes
   - Buildings feel more ordinary, more geometrically sound
   - Trade routes must return to conventional paths

**Bloom Strengthening:**
   - Plant growth accelerates noticeably week by week
   - Previously manageable vegetation becomes aggressive
   - Healing happens faster, sometimes too fast
   - Structural wood begins sprouting
   - Verdant sightings multiply

**Bloom Weakening:**
   - Growth slows to merely exceptional rather than explosive
   - Vegetation stops encroaching on structures
   - Agricultural yields decline
   - The air feels less vibrant, less alive

Experienced residents of convergence zones monitor these signs carefully. A strengthening surge might mean opportunity—or disaster, depending on preparedness.

Effects of Convergence Strength
--------------------------------

Weak Convergence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Threshold Effects:**
   Occasional spatial shortcuts appear but remain rare and unpredictable. A building might have one or two rooms that connect in unusual ways. Teleportation magic is slightly more reliable than normal but still requires full ritual components. Architecture is conventional except for rare oddities.

**Bloom Effects:**
   Plants grow perhaps 25% faster than in non-convergent areas. Healing is somewhat accelerated—cuts close in days instead of a week. Vegetation requires regular but not constant pruning. Agricultural yields are modestly better.

**Impact on Life:**
   Weak convergence is a curiosity more than a defining feature. It provides minor economic advantages but doesn't fundamentally reshape society. Most inhabitants barely notice it unless they've lived elsewhere for comparison.

Moderate Convergence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Threshold Effects:**
   Shortcuts are common and somewhat reliable. Most buildings have multiple unexpected connections. Entire districts develop navigational quirks that residents learn to use. Teleportation magic works with reduced component costs and increased range. Architecture begins incorporating impossible elements—not extreme, but noticeable.

**Bloom Effects:**
   Plant growth is three to four times normal speed, enabling multiple annual harvests. Healing is rapid enough to save many who would die in non-convergent areas. Buildings require weekly pruning. Specialized agriculture develops to handle hyper-productive crops.

**Impact on Life:**
   Moderate convergence significantly shapes daily existence. Cities develop unique layouts adapted to spatial shortcuts. Economies specialize in convergence-enabled trade or agriculture. Guilds of navigators, pruners, and planar scholars become essential. This is the sweet spot where convergence provides massive benefits with manageable challenges.

Strong Convergence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Threshold Effects:**
   Shortcuts are ubiquitous and chaotic. Rooms rearrange daily. New doorways appear overnight, leading to places miles away. Teleportation requires minimal effort, sometimes happening accidentally. Architecture is wildly impossible—buildings larger inside than outside, structures that contain themselves, corridors that form Klein bottles. Planar natives are common.

**Bloom Effects:**
   Growth is measured in hours, not days. A seed becomes a tree overnight. Wounds heal in minutes. Buildings are consumed by vegetation within days if not constantly pruned. Entire districts must be actively managed to prevent transformation into jungle. Living architecture becomes the norm—buildings grown as much as built, constantly tended.

**Impact on Life:**
   Strong convergence demands adaptation or abandonment. Normal life becomes impossible; everything must account for constant planar influence. But the rewards are proportional: instant long-distance transport, miraculous healing, agricultural abundance that can feed nations. These zones are strategic prizes worth any cost to control.

Convergence Interactions
-------------------------

When multiple planes converge on the same location, their influences interact in ways that can be synergistic, antagonistic, or simply strange.

Complementary Convergence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Threshold + Bloom: Living Labyrinths**
   Buildings that grow like organisms **and** rearrange their rooms create structures that are alive in every sense. Corridors sprout new branches. Rooms bud off chambers. The entire structure breathes and shifts. Navigation becomes a negotiation with a semi-aware architectural entity.

   Cities with strong dual convergence often treat their buildings as partners, feeding them appropriately and requesting passage rather than simply walking through. The most successful structures develop symbiotic relationships with their inhabitants.

**Threshold + Calcified Depths: Eternal Shortcuts**
   When connection meets preservation, the result is permanent, unvarying spatial shortcuts. A door that leads to a distant city will **always** lead to that city, never shifting. Trade guilds prize these stable portals above almost anything else, as they enable reliable long-distance commerce.

Antagonistic Convergence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bloom + Calcified Depths: Frozen Growth**
   Where growth meets stasis, the result is nightmarish. Plants that grow but cannot move, creating pressure that shatters stone. Healing that stops mid-process, leaving flesh partially regrown in agonizing suspension. These zones are rare and avoided—the two influences usually cancel out before reaching this state.

**Threshold + Resonance: Screaming Geometry**
   Connections that vibrate produce architecture that literally hums, sings, or screams depending on traffic patterns. Buildings become musical instruments played by the movement of inhabitants. Some find this beautiful. Most find it maddening.

Unpredictable Convergence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some combinations produce effects that follow no apparent logic:

- **Bloom + Resonance** might create plants that communicate through harmonic growth patterns, forming living information networks.

- **Threshold + Penumbra** could produce shortcuts that work only in darkness, or doorways that obscure their destination until entered.

- **Bloom + Penumbra** sometimes generates vegetation that exists half in shadow, neither fully material nor fully incorporeal.

Scholars catalog these interactions, but new combinations continue to surprise even the most experienced planar theorists.

Convergence and Magic
----------------------

Magic operates differently in convergence zones:

**Enhanced Effects**
   Spells aligned with a plane's nature become easier and more powerful. Teleportation magic in Threshold zones, healing magic in Bloom zones—these work with reduced cost and increased reliability.

**Hindered Effects**
   Magic that opposes a plane's nature becomes harder. Stasis magic in Bloom zones, decay magic in areas of strong vitality—these require additional effort and may fail unpredictably.

**Transformed Effects**
   Some spells warp when cast in strong convergence, taking on properties of the dominant plane. A fireball in a Threshold zone might connect to and ignite distant targets. The same spell in a Bloom zone might seed burning plants that spread the fire through aggressive growth.

Magical scholars debate endlessly about the "correct" approach to convergence-influenced spellcasting. Some argue for fighting the influence, maintaining orthodox technique. Others embrace it, developing entirely new schools of magic optimized for specific convergence types.

Living with Uncertainty
-----------------------

Perhaps the most fundamental aspect of convergence is its essential unpredictability. Patterns exist, but exceptions abound. Cycles can be observed, but they're never perfectly regular. A zone that's been stable for decades might suddenly surge. A city at the intersection of ley lines might inexplicably lose all convergence overnight.

This uncertainty shapes culture in convergent worlds. Plans must be flexible. Contingencies are essential. Adaptability becomes a survival trait. Those who succeed in the Convergence are those who embrace uncertainty rather than fighting it.

After all, in a world where reality itself refuses to remain fixed, rigidity is the greatest danger.
