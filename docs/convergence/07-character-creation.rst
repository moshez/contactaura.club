Character Creation
==================

Creating characters for the Convergence follows the standard Plasticine process with specific guidance for this setting. Characters should be competent adventurers capable of navigating convergence zones, understanding planar mechanics, and dealing with the unique challenges of a world where reality bleeds.

Campaign Parameters
-------------------

**Character Points:** 80 CP total
   This represents experienced adventurers who've already proven themselves. Fresh novices wouldn't survive in convergence zones.

**Problems:** 20-25 CP (recommended)
   Characters should have meaningful complications that create story hooks and provide extra CP for development.

**Power Level:** Heroic fantasy
   Characters are exceptional but not superhuman. They can handle dangerous convergence zones but aren't immune to harm. A well-placed attack from a skilled opponent is still lethal.

Character Concept
-----------------

Start with a clear concept that answers:

1. **What species are you?**
   Human, Strider, Faceted, Murmurati, or Unbound. This choice shapes your natural abilities and worldview.

2. **What's your profession or background?**
   Navigator, merchant, soldier, scholar, pruner, healer, spy? This informs your skills and connections.

3. **Why do you venture into convergence zones?**
   Profit? Knowledge? Duty? Thrill-seeking? Desperation? Your motivation drives the story.

4. **What's your relationship with convergence?**
   Do you embrace it, fear it, exploit it, study it? This affects how you approach challenges.

Species Selection
-----------------

Your species choice comes with certain expectations and opportunities:

Humans
~~~~~~

**Natural abilities:** None (all abilities must be purchased)

**Cultural background:** Humans can come from anywhere, represent any culture. They're the generalists.

**Recommended attributes:** Balanced across all four attributes. Humans succeed through preparation and adaptability.

**Recommended skills:** At least one Background skill for profession, Communication for social interaction, and skills relevant to your concept.

**Typical problems:** Social complications (debts, obligations, enemies), internal struggles (fears, limitations), or mechanical vulnerabilities.

Striders
~~~~~~~~

**Natural abilities:** Intuitive spatial awareness in Threshold zones (represented as a 2d6 skill: Threshold Navigation, included in base package)

**Cultural background:** Communal, connection-focused. Most Striders maintain elaborate social networks.

**Recommended attributes:** High PER (to sense connections), moderate ACT (to move quickly through shortcuts), decent DEF (since ACC is less useful in navigation-heavy play).

**Recommended skills:** Communication (to maintain social networks), Seeking (to find shortcuts), Background skills related to navigation or social coordination.

**Typical problems:** Social complications (overwhelming obligations to social network), internal issues (severe distress when isolated), or mechanical vulnerabilities (reduced effectiveness outside Threshold zones).

**Required problem:** "Psychological: Distress when isolated" (5-10 CP depending on severity) reflects their fundamental nature.

Faceted
~~~~~~~

**Natural abilities:** Fragmented perception allowing detection of convergence boundaries (represented as 2d6 skill: Convergence Perception, included in base package)

**Cultural background:** Observer-focused, value multiple perspectives. Faceted rarely commit to absolute positions.

**Recommended attributes:** Very high PER (their defining trait), moderate to high ACC (they notice weak points), variable DEF and ACT depending on concept.

**Recommended skills:** Background skills (scholarship, observation), Unopposed skills for detailed analysis.

**Typical problems:** Internal complications (inability to commit to single viewpoint), mechanical vulnerabilities (brittle crystalline skin making them more fragile), or social issues (frustration from others who want clear answers).

**Physical trait:** Faceted take 25% more Body damage (represents crystalline fragility). This is a mandatory 5 CP problem: "Mechanical: Fragile crystalline structure."

Murmurati
~~~~~~~~~

**Natural abilities:** Harmonic communication and bioluminescence (represented as Signal power at 1d6, included in base package, and inherent immunity to deception through harmonics)

**Cultural background:** Consensus-building, harmony-focused. Murmurati make decisions slowly and collectively.

**Recommended attributes:** Moderate across all attributes. They're not specialists in combat.

**Recommended skills:** Communication (their natural strength), healing skills, Bloom-related knowledge.

**Typical problems:** Social complications (difficulty lying or keeping secrets), internal issues (slow decision-making in emergencies), mechanical limitations (harmonic communication doesn't work in all situations).

**Communication trait:** Murmurati cannot convincingly lie—their harmonics betray true feelings. This is worth 5 CP as "Mechanical: Cannot lie effectively."

Unbound
~~~~~~~

**Natural abilities:** Partial intangibility in Threshold zones (represented as a limited Move power: 5m ignoring obstacles, only in Threshold zones, included in base package)

**Cultural background:** Transient, present-focused. Unbound struggle with permanence.

**Recommended attributes:** High DEF (hard to hit when partially intangible), moderate to high ACT, variable ACC and PER.

**Recommended skills:** Evasion, Stealth, Threshold-related knowledge.

**Typical problems:** Mechanical limitations (weak or exhausted outside Threshold zones), social complications (difficulty forming lasting relationships), internal issues (discomfort with permanence).

**Required limitation:** Unbound struggle outside Threshold zones. Most of their powers should include "Only in Threshold convergence zones" (0.5-1.0 limitation depending on how restrictive).

Base Packages by Species
-------------------------

These are the baseline abilities every member of each species gets for free (already included in your 80 CP):

**All Species:**
   - 2d6 in all four attributes (54 CP value)
   - Basic communication in native language
   - Basic movement (5m, walking only)

**Striders (Additional 6 CP):**
   - Threshold Navigation: 2d6 unopposed skill

**Faceted (Additional 6 CP):**
   - Convergence Perception: 2d6 unopposed skill

**Murmurati (Additional 6 CP):**
   - Harmonic Signal: 1d6 (can communicate with willing recipients who understand harmonics)
   - Bioluminescence (cosmetic, no CP cost)

**Unbound (Additional 6 CP):**
   - Limited Intangibility: Move 5m, ignore obstacles, only in Threshold zones

After accounting for base packages and mandatory species problems, humans start with ~80 CP to spend, while other species start with ~74 CP (but have 6 CP worth of abilities included and 5-10 CP from mandatory problems, netting them ~79-84 CP total).

Attributes
----------

**Action (ACT):** How often you act in combat or time-sensitive situations.
   - 3d6 (27 CP): Standard, acts most rounds
   - 4d6 (39 CP): Fast, acts nearly every round
   - 5d6 (48 CP): Exceptional, rarely fails to act

**Accuracy (ACC):** Your ability to hit targets in combat.
   - 3d6 (9 CP): Baseline competence
   - 4d6 (12 CP): Skilled combatant
   - 5d6 (15 CP): Master

**Defense (DEF):** Your ability to avoid being hit.
   - 3d6 (9 CP): Baseline competence
   - 4d6 (12 CP): Difficult to hit

   - 3d6 (9 CP): Standard awareness
   - 4d6 (12 CP): Observant
   - 5d6+ (15+ CP): Exceptional, notices subtle details

**Recommendations:**
   - Combat-focused characters should have at least 4d6 ACC and 4d6 DEF
   - Navigation specialists should have at least 4d6 PER
   - Social characters can get away with 3d6 in combat attributes
   - Everyone should have at least 3d6 ACT (acting rarely is frustrating)

Skills
------

Background Skills (3 pips/1 CP)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Represent professional knowledge, academic training, or life experience. Examples:

- **Background: Cartography** (for navigators and explorers)

- **Background: Botany** (for those working with Bloom zones)
- **Background: Architecture** (for understanding impossible buildings)
- **Background: Trade** (for merchants)
- **Background: Military Tactics** (for soldiers)

Most characters should have 2-3 background skills at 3d6-4d6 (3-4 CP each).

Unopposed Skills (1 pip/1 CP)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Represent practical abilities used in non-contested situations:

- **Systems: Navigation tools** (using maps, compasses, convergence detectors)

Invest 3-9 CP if your concept involves these activities.

Powers
------

   - Buy off problems (with GM permission, if circumstances change)
   - Acquire helpers (guides, equipment, bases)

Characters grow through play, becoming more capable navigators of the Convergence's strange reality.
