Powers and Magic in the Convergence
====================================

Magic in the Convergence is fundamentally about harnessing planar influence. Rather than drawing on abstract "mana" or divine power, practitioners channel the properties of overlapping planes to achieve effects. This makes magic location-dependent, variable, and deeply tied to understanding convergence mechanics.

Convergence-Influenced Magic
-----------------------------

All magic works differently in convergence zones. The strength and type of convergence affects what spells can do, how reliably they function, and what side effects they produce.

General Principles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**In Threshold Zones:**
   - Teleportation and movement magic becomes easier (reduce CP cost by 25-50%)
   - Connection-based effects (communication, detection of distant objects) are enhanced
   - Spatial manipulation works more reliably
   - Stasis and binding magic becomes harder (increase CP cost by 25-50%)

**In Bloom Zones:**
   - Healing and growth magic becomes more powerful (reduce CP cost by 25-50%)
   - Organic manipulation works better
   - Decay and destruction magic requires more effort (increase CP cost by 25-50%)
   - Living materials respond to magical shaping

**In Other Convergence Types:**
   - Calcified Depths: Preservation magic easier, transformation harder
   - Resonance: Sound-based magic easier, silence effects harder
   - Penumbra: Concealment magic easier, illumination harder

**Outside Convergence:**
   - All convergence-based magic costs 50-100% more CP
   - Effects are weaker and less reliable
   - Some specialized effects may not function at all

These modifiers apply when building powers. A character who specializes in Threshold magic might build their teleportation as:

   - Move 20m (4 CP)
   - Advantages: Ignore obstacles (×2) = 8 CP
   - Limitations: Only in Threshold zones (0.5), Gestures (0.5), Concentration (0.5), Requires understanding of spatial connections (0.5)
   - Cost: 8/3 = 2.67 CP (round to 3 CP)

The "Only in Threshold zones" limitation is significant (0.5) because it makes the power useless in large portions of the world, but in Threshold zones, this teleportation is incredibly cheap and effective.

Schools of Magic
----------------

Magical traditions organize around understanding and channeling specific planes.

Threshold Wayfinding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Philosophy:** Space is negotiable. Distance is illusion. Connection is reality.

Practitioners study the nature of the Threshold, learning to perceive and manipulate spatial connections. They become navigators first, mages second—their magic emerges from deep understanding of how the Threshold operates.

**Core Abilities:**

**Spatial Sense**
   - Detect: Spatial connections 3d6 (9 CP)
   - Advantages: Range 50m (×8) = 72 CP, Constant (×2) = 144 CP
   - Limitations: Only detects Threshold connections (0.5), Only in convergence zones (0.5), Requires training to interpret (0.5), Mental strain after extended use (0.5)
   - Cost: 144/3 = 48 CP

   This represents the fundamental Wayfinding ability: constant awareness of shortcuts, connections, and spatial relationships. Expensive but foundational to the tradition.

**Short Jaunt**
   - Move: 10m (2 CP)
   - Advantages: Ignore obstacles (×2) = 4 CP, Can bring touched allies (×2) = 8 CP
   - Limitations: Only in Threshold zones (0.5), Gestures (0.5), Requires seeing destination (0.5), Mental fatigue (0.5)
   - Cost: 8/3 = 2.67 CP (round to 3 CP)

**Doorway Anchor**
   - Create a permanent connection between two locations
   - Complex power involving constant Reduce (to reality's resistance to shortcuts) at both endpoints
   - Approximate cost: 50-80 CP depending on distance and stability
   - Most Wayfinders can't afford this until late career
   - When they can, they become extraordinarily valuable

**Typical Wayfinder Build (80 CP character):**
   - High PER (to sense connections): 4d6+ (12-15 CP)
   - Moderate other attributes: 3d6 each (45 CP for the other three)
   - Spatial Sense: 48 CP
   - Short Jaunt: 3 CP
   - Background: Threshold Mechanics 4d6: 4 CP
   - Basic combat capability: 10-15 CP
   - Total: ~122-127 CP before problems
   - Need 40-45 CP from problems to afford this build

   Wayfinders are expensive to build but incredibly specialized and valuable.

Bloom Cultivation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Philosophy:** Life proliferates. Growth is inevitable. Healing is natural.

Practitioners attune themselves to the Bloom, learning to encourage, direct, and control organic growth. They can heal injuries, shape living matter, and coax plants to grow in specific patterns.

**Core Abilities:**

**Accelerated Healing**
   - Improve Body 3d6 (45 CP), doubled cost for Improve = 90 CP
   - Limitations: Touch range (0.5), Only in Bloom zones (0.5), Requires time (hours not minutes) (0.5), Can cause uncontrolled growth if overdone (0.5), Requires medical knowledge (0.5)
   - Cost: 90/3.5 = 25.7 CP (round to 26 CP)

   This is powerful healing but requires being in a Bloom zone and carries risks of complications.

**Growth Shaping**
   - Push: 3 weight classes (3 CP) for forcing plant growth in specific directions
   - Special: Affects living plants rather than inert objects
   - Limitations: Only affects plants (1.0), Only in Bloom zones (0.5), Requires time (0.5), Requires concentration (0.5)
   - Cost: 3/3.5 = 0.86 CP (round to 1 CP)

   Incredibly cheap utility ability for directing growth. A Cultivator can reshape living architecture, clear vegetation, or create barriers of thorns.

**Bloom Attunement**
   - Resistance: Body adjustments 3d6 (45 CP)
   - Limitations: Only against Bloom-caused overgrowth/uncontrolled healing (1.0), Only while in Bloom zones (0.5)
   - Cost: 45/2.5 = 18 CP

   Protects against growth spirals and healing gone wrong. Essential for working safely in strong Bloom zones.

**Typical Cultivator Build (80 CP character):**
   - Moderate attributes: 3d6 each (54 CP)
   - Accelerated Healing: 26 CP
   - Growth Shaping: 1 CP
   - Bloom Attunement: 18 CP
   - Background: Botany 4d6: 4 CP
   - Background: Medicine 3d6: 3 CP
   - Basic combat: 10 CP
   - Total: ~116 CP before problems
   - Need 35-40 CP from problems

   Cultivators are more affordable than Wayfinders and have broader utility.

Harmonic Resonance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Philosophy:** Everything vibrates. Sound is substance. Harmony shapes reality.

Practitioners of Harmonic Resonance work with the Resonance plane's influence, using vibration and sound to affect the world. This tradition is popular among Murmurati but practiced by all species.

**Core Abilities:**

**Harmonic Communication**
   - Signal: Complex information 3d6 (9 CP)
   - Advantages: Range 1km (×11) = 99 CP, Multiple recipients (×2) = 198 CP
   - Limitations: Requires harmonic training to receive (0.5), Sound-based (can be blocked by silence or noise) (0.5), Requires concentration (0.5), Works best in Resonance zones (0.5)
   - Cost: 198/3 = 66 CP

   Allows long-distance communication through harmonic resonance. Expensive but incredibly valuable for coordinated operations.

**Disruptive Tone**
   - Reduce Accuracy 2d6 (30 CP)
   - Advantages: Area of Effect 5m radius (×3) = 90 CP
   - Limitations: Affects everyone in area including allies (0.5), Sound-based (can be blocked) (0.5), Requires verbalization (0.5), Cool down 3 actions (1.0)
   - Cost: 90/3.5 = 25.7 CP (round to 26 CP)

   Combat application: disorienting enemies through discordant tones.

**Resonant Detection**
   - Detect: Sound/vibrations 3d6 (9 CP)
   - Advantages: Range 50m (×8) = 72 CP, Penetrating (through walls) (×2) = 144 CP
   - Limitations: Only sound/vibration (0.5), Requires quiet to focus (0.5)
   - Cost: 144/2 = 72 CP

   Expensive but allows sensing through walls, detecting movement, and perceiving through sound rather than sight.

**Typical Resonance Practitioner (80 CP):**
   Extremely expensive tradition. Most practitioners specialize in one or two core abilities rather than mastering all three.

Multi-Planar Synthesis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Philosophy:** Planes interact. Synthesis creates emergence. Understanding multiplicity grants power.

Some practitioners study how different planar influences interact, developing magic that works at convergence boundaries or leverages planar interaction effects.

**Core Abilities:**

**Convergence Sight**
   - Detect: Convergence strength and type 4d6 (12 CP)
   - Advantages: Range 100m (×11) = 132 CP, Analyze (understand type and strength) (×2) = 264 CP, Constant (×2) = 528 CP
   - Limitations: Mental strain from constant use (0.5), Requires training to interpret (0.5), Can be overwhelming in strong convergence (0.5)
   - Cost: 528/2.5 = 211 CP

   This is prohibitively expensive at heroic power levels. Most Synthesis practitioners have much weaker versions (2d6, shorter range, not constant) or rely on instruments rather than innate ability.

**Planar Manipulation**
   - Temporarily strengthen or weaken local convergence
   - This is essentially Improve/Reduce applied to the convergence itself
   - Incredibly complex, very expensive, and risky
   - Generally beyond PC capabilities until high experience levels
   - NPC specialists might have this ability

The Synthesis approach is more common as a scholarly tradition than practical magic at heroic power levels. Characters might have Background: Planar Synthesis and use it to understand convergence without having expensive active powers.

Artifact Magic
--------------

Instead of learning to channel planar energy directly, some practitioners use artifacts—objects permanently infused with planar influence that grant abilities to whoever wields them.

Creating Artifacts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Plasticine terms, an artifact is purchased as a Helper with the "item" special effect. Calculate the cost of the powers it grants, divide by 5, and that's the CP cost to the character.

**Example: Wayfinder's Compass**
   - Grants Detect: Spatial connections 2d6, Range 20m, Constant
   - Raw cost: 6 CP → 120 CP with advantages → 60 CP after limitations (only detects shortcuts 0.5, only in Threshold zones 0.5)
   - As Helper: 60/5 = 12 CP

A character can purchase this artifact for 12 CP rather than learning Wayfinding directly.

**Example: Bloom Healer's Staff**
   - Grants Improve Body 2d6, Touch range
   - Raw cost: 30 CP → 15 CP after limitations (only in Bloom zones 0.5, requires time 0.5, medical knowledge required 0.5, risk of overgrowth 0.5)
   - As Helper: 15/5 = 3 CP

Very affordable, but requires being in Bloom zones and having medical knowledge to use safely.

**Example: Resonance Crystal**
   - Grants Signal 2d6, Range 500m
   - Raw cost: 6 CP → 132 CP with range → 66 CP after limitations (sound-based 0.5, requires harmonic training 0.5)
   - As Helper: 66/5 = 13.2 CP (round to 13 CP)

Artifacts allow characters to access convergence magic without extensive training, at reduced CP cost but with the vulnerability that artifacts can be lost, stolen, or broken.

Common Magical Effects
----------------------

These are frequently purchased powers with convergence-appropriate flavor:

Navigation and Movement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Create Shortcut (Temporary)**
   - Requires understanding Threshold mechanics deeply
   - Essentially a long-range Move power with "creates passage others can use" modifier
   - Very expensive (40+ CP typically) but allows ferrying groups through shortcuts

**Bloom-Path Walking**
   - Move through dense vegetation without impediment
   - Move 5m, ignore obstacles, only in Bloom zones, only through vegetation
   - Very cheap (1-2 CP after limitations)

**Shadow Step**
   - Move through areas touched by Penumbra
   - Move 10m, ignore obstacles, only in darkness/shadow, only in Penumbra zones
   - Moderate cost (5-8 CP)

Detection and Perception
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Planar Scent**
   - Some people develop ability to literally smell different convergence types
   - Detect: Convergence type 2d6, short range, only general type not precise strength
   - Cheap (3-5 CP) but useful for avoiding dangers

**Threshold Echo Reading**
   - Detect where shortcuts have recently been used
   - Detect: Recent Threshold activity, moderate range
   - Useful for tracking or security (8-12 CP)

**Bloom Sense**
   - Feel the vitality of living things
   - Detect: Life energy, moderate range, only living organisms
   - Useful for finding hidden creatures or assessing health (6-10 CP)

Combat and Defense
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Spatial Displacement Strike**
   - Attack by briefly opening a small Threshold connection through an enemy
   - Reduce Body, ranged, uses PER to resist instead of DEF
   - Expensive but bypasses conventional defense (30-40 CP typically)

**Thorn Barrier**
   - Cause rapid growth of defensive thorns
   - Reduce Move in area, only in Bloom zones, affects plants
   - Moderate cost, area denial (12-18 CP)

**Harmonic Shield**
   - Create vibrating air that deflects attacks
   - Improve DEF, self only, sound-based, works best in Resonance zones
   - Moderate cost (10-15 CP)

Utility and Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Preservation Field**
   - Create small zone of Calcified Depths influence
   - Reduce all change in area, short duration, requires concentration
   - Useful for preserving evidence or preventing decay
   - Moderate cost (12-18 CP)

**Living Architecture Command**
   - Communicate with and direct Bloom-influenced buildings
   - Signal: Instructions to plant-based structures, touch range
   - Cheap if limited to Bloom zones (3-5 CP)

**Convergence Anchor**
   - Stabilize local convergence, preventing sudden shifts
   - Complex power, essentially Resistance to convergence changes
   - Expensive (25-35 CP) but valuable in unstable zones

Magical Traditions and Training
--------------------------------

Learning magic in the Convergence requires three components:

1. **Theoretical Understanding** (Background skills)
2. **Practical Ability** (Powers)
3. **Experience with Convergence** (Time spent in zones)

Most traditions involve:
   - 2-4 years of formal study (represented by Background skills)
   - Gradual development of powers through practice
   - Apprenticeship or field experience in appropriate convergence zones

This means that:
   - Young mages tend to have good Background skills but weak powers
   - Experienced practitioners have developed strong powers but may lack formal training
   - Masters combine deep theoretical knowledge with powerful practical abilities

Magical Organizations
---------------------

Several organizations train and coordinate magic users:

**The Wayfinder's Guild**
   - Trains Threshold specialists
   - Maintains maps of known shortcuts
   - Hires out navigators to expeditions
   - Politically neutral (claims to be, anyway)

**The Cultivator's Circle**
   - Bloom specialists organized as healing collective
   - Operates hospitals in Bloom zones
   - Researches safe healing techniques
   - Sometimes conflicts with agricultural interests

**The Academy of Synthesis**
   - Multi-planar research institution
   - More scholarly than practical
   - Publishes research on convergence mechanics
   - Trains the few Synthesis practitioners

**Independent Practitioners**
   - Many mages work independently
   - Artifact users especially common among independents
   - Some are self-taught, others studied then left organizations
   - Variable quality and ethics

Dangers of Convergence Magic
-----------------------------

Magic that channels planar influence carries specific risks:

**Threshold Dangers:**
   - Getting lost in endless connections, unable to return to starting point
   - Mental fragmentation from perceiving too many simultaneous spaces
   - Inadvertently opening connections to dangerous locations
   - Attention from powerful Wanderers or other Threshold entities

**Bloom Dangers:**
   - Healing that doesn't stop, causing tumorous growth
   - Directing plants that then grow beyond control
   - Attracting Verdants who view manipulation as cooperation invitation
   - Becoming so attuned to Bloom that leaving those zones is painful

**Resonance Dangers:**
   - Hearing harmonics that drive you mad
   - Permanent hearing damage from combat applications
   - Resonating in sync with dangerous frequencies
   - Unable to tolerate silence

**General Convergence Dangers:**
   - Becoming dependent on convergence energy (addiction-like)
   - Inability to function in non-convergent areas
   - Transformation: slowly taking on properties of the plane you channel
   - Planar attention: beings from those planes noticing you

These dangers can be represented as Problems, temporary conditions, or permanent character changes depending on severity.

Magic in Play
-------------

When players use convergence magic:

**Always Consider Location**
   Current convergence strength and type should affect reliability and power. A Wayfinder in a strong Threshold zone operates at peak effectiveness. The same character in a non-convergent area struggles.

**Track Consequences**
   Magic that manipulates reality should have ripple effects. Creating a shortcut might make nearby spaces unstable. Aggressive healing might cause local growth spirals. Sound-based combat might attract attention.

**Reward Understanding**
   Players who learn convergence mechanics, study planar theory, and understand how their magic works should benefit. Grant bonuses for clever applications or penalties for misunderstanding.

**Maintain Mystery**
   Not everything should be fully understood. Convergence has been studied for generations but still surprises scholars. Unknown effects, unpredictable interactions, and strange phenomena keep magic interesting.

Convergence magic is powerful but conditional, useful but risky, and deeply tied to understanding a world where reality itself refuses to stay fixed.
