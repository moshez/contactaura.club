Locations and Convergence Zones
================================

Border Cities
-------------

The term "border city" doesn't refer to political boundaries—it describes cities that exist at the borders between planes, where convergence is strong enough to shape every aspect of life. These are the great cities of the setting, centers of power, trade, and strangeness.

Nexus
~~~~~

**Convergence:** Strong Threshold, Moderate Bloom
**Population:** ~200,000
**Character:** The greatest trading city in the known world

Nexus stands at the intersection of three major ley lines, creating convergence so intense that the city's geography changes daily. The Council of Cartographers publishes new maps each morning, noting which districts are currently adjacent and which shortcuts are reliable. Visitors must hire navigators or risk spending days trying to reach destinations that should be hours away.

The city's wealth comes from its position. Merchants can ship goods from Nexus to nearly anywhere, bypassing normal geography entirely. A warehouse in the Threshold Quarter might have doors opening to a dozen distant cities. Trade guilds maintain stable portals at enormous expense, enabling regular commerce despite the chaos.

Architecture in Nexus is built for adaptation. Buildings are modular, designed to function regardless of which structures they're currently adjacent to. The most expensive properties are those along Resonance Street, where shortcuts remain unusually stable. The poorest districts cluster in the Shifting Maze, where rooms rearrange hourly and residents navigate by intuition more than maps.

The Bloom influence manifests in the Garden Tier, a vertical stack of agricultural platforms that feed the city. Growth is so rapid that farmers harvest multiple times daily. Specialized pruner guilds work constantly to prevent the gardens from consuming the entire tier in living vegetation.

**Adventure Hooks:**
- Merchants hire guides to navigate the Shifting Maze to deliver time-sensitive goods
- A valuable portal suddenly connects to an unknown location; someone needs to explore it
- Growth spirals in the Garden Tier threaten to break containment
- Political rivals manipulate cartographers to mislead opponents' shipments

Verdant Reach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Convergence:** Strong Bloom, Weak Threshold
**Population:** ~50,000
**Character:** The agricultural heart of an empire

Built in a river valley where Bloom convergence has remained strong for three centuries, Verdant Reach supplies food to a dozen major cities. The surrounding farmland produces yields ten times that of normal agriculture. Entire crops grow, mature, and are harvested within weeks.

But Bloom influence this strong comes with costs. The city itself is alive. Buildings are grown from trained vegetation, their walls made of woven vines thick as trees. Streets are cleared corridors through deliberate vegetation rather than paved pathways. Every structure requires daily tending—water, pruning, pest control. Neglect a building for a week and it becomes uninhabitable jungle.

The population divides into three castes: Growers (who tend the crops), Shapers (who maintain the living architecture), and Traders (who distribute the bounty). Each caste has specialized training in working with hyper-vitalized plant life. Outsiders find the city almost incomprehensible—less a settlement and more a managed ecosystem.

Healing in Verdant Reach is miraculous. Injuries that would be fatal elsewhere are treatable. The city's hospitals are famous throughout the land, drawing pilgrims desperate for cures. But healers must be careful—overexposure to Bloom influence can cause uncontrolled tissue growth. The city's graveyards contain monuments to those who healed too well.

**Adventure Hooks:**
- A mysterious blight affects the crops despite the Bloom; investigation needed
- The living city is growing faster than Shapers can control
- Pilgrims arrive seeking healing for a terrible plague
- Foreign powers attempt sabotage to disrupt food supplies

The Hollows
~~~~~~~~~~~

**Convergence:** Moderate Threshold, Moderate Calcified Depths
**Population:** ~30,000
**Character:** A city of perfect preservation and eerie stillness

The Hollows exists where Threshold convergence meets the rare influence of the Calcified Depths. The result is a city of eternal, unchanging shortcuts. A door that leads to the market square has led there for two hundred years and will lead there for two hundred more. Maps of the Hollows, once drawn, never need updating.

This stability makes the Hollows invaluable for long-term storage. Perishable goods don't perish here. Food remains fresh indefinitely. Even living things age more slowly—rumors suggest that ancient residents have lived for centuries, their lifespans stretched by planar influence.

But stillness is not without its price. The city feels frozen, suspended. Newcomers find it oppressive—the air tastes stale, colors seem muted, and time itself feels sluggish. Long-term residents become increasingly resistant to change, both in environment and thought. The Council of Keepers, which has governed the Hollows for generations, consists largely of the same individuals, aging at a fraction of normal rates.

The perfect preservation extends to death. Bodies in the Hollows don't decay, making traditional burial impossible. Instead, the city maintains the Eternal Gallery, where the deceased are preserved in crystalline stasis, neither truly gone nor fully at rest.

**Adventure Hooks:**
- Valuable artifacts need to be retrieved from the Eternal Gallery
- A faction seeks to disrupt the convergence, threatening the city's stability
- Ancient residents hold knowledge of events centuries past
- Thieves target the preservation vaults containing priceless perishables

Localized Convergence Zones
----------------------------

Not all convergence creates cities. Many zones are smaller, more focused, but no less significant.

The Wandering Wood
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Convergence:** Moderate Threshold
**Character:** A forest where paths refuse to stay fixed

The Wandering Wood covers several hundred square miles, but navigation within it is essentially impossible without a guide. Paths shift overnight. Clearings move to new locations. Travelers report walking in straight lines and emerging from the opposite direction they entered.

Despite this chaos, the Wood maintains a kind of internal logic. Destinations are reached based on need and intent rather than direction. Those desperately seeking water find streams. Those fleeing danger discover hidden glades. The Wood seems almost sentient, responding to the emotional state of travelers.

Hermits and outcasts make homes in the Wandering Wood, building shelters that relocate along with the shifting geography. They develop intuitive understanding of the Wood's patterns, able to navigate by feel rather than map. Some hire themselves as guides; others prefer isolation.

The Wood is also home to Threshold natives, Wanderers who find its ever-changing nature comfortable. They sometimes trade with Material travelers, exchanging guidance or information for objects of fixed position—things that anchor them temporarily to Material reality.

**Adventure Hooks:**
- Rescue a lost noble's child somewhere in the ever-shifting Wood
- Retrieve a rare herb that grows only in specific clearings
- Negotiate with Wanderers for access to a particular destination
- Investigate why the Wood's patterns have suddenly changed

The Spiral Depths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Convergence:** Strong Bloom
**Type:** Living dungeon complex

What was once a conventional dungeon complex—built by an ancient civilization for purposes now forgotten—has been transformed by intense Bloom convergence into something entirely other. The Spiral Depths are alive in the most literal sense.

Corridors are lined with pulsing organic matter. Walls breathe. Floors consist of layered vegetation. The entire structure grows, adapting to intrusion. Cut through a living wall and it regenerates within hours. Clear a room of hostile vegetation and new growth sprouts overnight.

But the Depths are also incredibly valuable. Organisms that grow under such intense Bloom influence produce substances impossible to replicate elsewhere—healing compounds, rare alchemical components, materials with unique properties. Expeditions delve into the Depths regularly, racing to harvest resources before the dungeon's defenses adapt.

The deeper levels show signs of intelligence. Rooms seem to learn from previous intrusions, developing new defenses. Some scholars theorize the entire complex has become a single vast organism, dimly aware and protective of its core.

**Adventure Hooks:**
- Harvest a rare component from the deep levels before it's absorbed
- Investigate why the Depths have begun expanding beyond their normal bounds
- Rescue a previous expedition that has become trapped in shifting corridors
- Discover the source of the Bloom convergence at the Spiral's heart

The Shattered Plaza
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Convergence:** Strong Threshold (unstable)
**Type:** Dangerous urban phenomenon

Once a thriving market square in a major city, the Shattered Plaza underwent a sudden surge in Threshold convergence three years ago. Now it's one of the most dangerous places in the region.

Connections in the Plaza multiply uncontrollably. Every door, window, and archway leads somewhere random. Step through a merchant's stall and emerge from a fountain three streets away. Walk through an open plaza and find yourself in a sealed basement. Distances are meaningless; cause and effect break down.

The city has sealed the Plaza, maintaining a quarantine zone around it. But treasures remain inside—goods abandoned during the initial chaos, now impossible to retrieve through normal means. Thieves and desperate merchants occasionally brave the Shattered Plaza, trying to reach specific locations, retrieve specific items. Most get hopelessly lost. Some never return.

Scholars study the Plaza from the quarantine zone's edge, trying to understand what caused the surge and whether it might spread. If the instability reaches beyond the quarantine, it could consume the entire city.

**Adventure Hooks:**
- Recover a valuable item from a specific shop in the Plaza
- Rescue someone who entered and became lost in the shifting connections
- Prevent saboteurs from breaking the quarantine
- Discover whether the surge is natural or was deliberately caused

Strategic Convergence Points
-----------------------------

Certain convergence zones have such strategic value that they define regional politics.

The Iron Pass
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Convergence:** Moderate Threshold
**Strategic Value:** Military chokepoint with spatial shortcuts

The Iron Pass is the only conventional route through a mountain range separating two major nations. But Threshold influence has riddled the Pass with shortcuts, enabling small forces to bypass fortifications, appear behind enemy lines, or retreat to safety through unexpected doorways.

Both nations maintain fortresses along the Pass, but conventional military doctrine is useless here. Sieges mean nothing when defenders can resupply through shortcuts. Numerical superiority is irrelevant when attackers can appear anywhere. Conflict in the Iron Pass is fought by specialists—navigators who understand the shifting connections, scouts who can map reliable shortcuts, saboteurs who can seal or create doorways.

Control of the Pass shifts frequently. A nation might dominate for years, then lose everything when convergence patterns change and their strategic shortcuts vanish. Long-term planning is nearly impossible.

**Adventure Hooks:**
- Guide a military force through newly discovered shortcuts
- Sabotage enemy attempts to map reliable passages
- Negotiate with Threshold natives who claim ownership of the Pass
- Investigate whether convergence strength is being artificially manipulated

The Breadbasket
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Convergence:** Moderate to Strong Bloom
**Strategic Value:** Food production for multiple regions

A fertile plain where Bloom convergence has remained strong for generations, the Breadbasket produces enough food to support three major cities and dozens of smaller settlements. Whoever controls this region controls the food supply for a significant fraction of the population.

The Breadbasket is nominally independent, governed by a coalition of farming families, but in practice it faces constant pressure from surrounding powers. Trade agreements are renegotiated annually. Military "advisors" from various nations are permanently stationed to "protect agricultural interests." Espionage is rampant.

The farmers themselves have developed sophisticated techniques for managing hyper-productive crops. They've learned to direct growth, to prevent certain plants from overwhelming others, to harvest efficiently despite constant new growth. This knowledge makes them valuable—and vulnerable.

If Bloom convergence were to fade, the entire regional food economy would collapse. If it were to strengthen beyond current levels, the Breadbasket could become ungovernable, consumed by vegetation faster than any number of farmers could manage.

**Adventure Hooks:**
- Investigate sabotage attempts on critical crops
- Protect farming families from foreign operatives
- Deal with a growth spiral threatening to consume fields
- Negotiate trade agreements between hostile powers

Living in Convergence Zones
----------------------------

Daily life in convergence zones requires adaptation:

**Navigation Specialists**
   Cities with strong Threshold influence employ professional navigators. These experts maintain mental maps of shifting connections, update route information, and guide travelers safely. The best navigators develop almost intuitive sense of planar flow.

**Pruner Guilds**
   Areas with Bloom influence need constant vegetation management. Pruners are part gardener, part warrior, trained to handle aggressive plant growth and the occasional hostile organism. They work in teams, clearing encroachment and maintaining livable spaces.

**Planar Scholars**
   Understanding convergence is essential for long-term planning. Scholars study ley lines, track convergence cycles, predict shifts. Their knowledge informs everything from construction planning to trade route development to military strategy.

**Adaptation Architects**
   Building in convergence zones requires specialized knowledge. Structures must accommodate shifting connections, resist aggressive growth, or actively incorporate planar influence. Adaptation architects design these buildings, creating spaces that work with convergence rather than fighting it.

These professions don't exist outside convergence zones. They emerge as necessary adaptations to life where reality itself refuses conventional rules.

The Unknown Zones
-----------------

Not all convergence zones are mapped or understood. The world is large, and convergence appears in unexpected places. Rumors persist of zones with properties unlike any documented plane—areas where gravity inverts, where thought becomes tangible, where time runs backward. Explorers seek these unknown zones, hoping to find new resources, new power, new understanding.

Some rumors are certainly false. Others might be accurate. In a world where planes overlap and reality bleeds, the line between impossible and merely undiscovered is often unclear.
