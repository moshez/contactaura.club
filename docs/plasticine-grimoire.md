### 1. Spark (5 CP)
**Category**: Attack
**Effect**: 1d6 Reduce Body, Touch range
**Limitations**: Gestures (0.5), Verbal (0.5), Skill Roll (0.5)
**Cost Calculation**: Base 9 CP ÷ (1+1.5) = 3.6 CP → 5 CP with minor improvements
**Description**: A minor shocking touch that delivers a jolt of magical energy. Perfect for teaching lessons or disabling unarmored opponents. The caster must touch the target while speaking the word of power.

### 2. Mystic Sense (7 CP)
**Category**: Utility
**Effect**: 2d6 Detect (Magic), 5m range
**Limitations**: Concentration (0.5), Verbal (0.5)
**Cost Calculation**: Base 14 CP ÷ (1+1.0) = 7 CP
**Description**: Opens the caster's awareness to the flows of magical energy nearby. Enchantments, active spells, and magical items shimmer with a faint colored haze visible only to the caster. Maintaining the sense requires continuous humming of a specific tone.

### 3. Luminary Orb (8 CP)
**Category**: Utility
**Effect**: 1d6 Signal (Light), 10m range, sustained
**Limitations**: Gestures (0.5), Concentration (0.5)
**Cost Calculation**: Base 12 CP ÷ (1+1.0) = 6 CP → 8 CP with duration
**Description**: Conjures a glowing sphere of soft radiance that hovers and drifts according to the caster's hand gestures. The orb can be any color the caster desires and illuminates dark spaces without heat or smoke. Loses cohesion if concentration lapses.

### 4. Aetheric Bolt (10 CP)
**Category**: Attack
**Effect**: 1d6 Reduce Body, Ranged 10m
**Limitations**: Gestures (0.5), Verbal (0.5), Skill Roll (0.5), Cool Down (1.0)
**Cost Calculation**: Base 36 CP ÷ (1+2.5) = 10.3 CP → 10 CP

### 5. Wind Cushion (12 CP)
**Category**: Defense
**Effect**: 2d6 Move (Slow Fall), Self or Touch
**Limitations**: Gestures (0.5), Verbal (0.5), Concentration (0.5)
**Cost Calculation**: Base 24 CP ÷ (1+1.5) = 9.6 CP → 12 CP
**Description**: Summons a cushion of compressed air beneath the falling target, dramatically slowing their descent. The caster's hands must weave continuous patterns to maintain the updraft, making this spell impractical to cast on oneself while falling—better to cast it before the plunge.

### 6. Minor Working (8 CP)

**Effect**: 1d6 Push, 5m range, fine manipulation
**Limitations**: Gestures (0.5), Concentration (0.5), Limited to small objects (0.5)
**Cost Calculation**: Base 16 CP ÷ (1+1.5) = 6.4 CP → 8 CP

Street performers and tavern entertainers rely on this fundamental trick of the trade.

**Category**: Defense
**Effect**: 1d6 Improve Defense, Self only
**Limitations**: Gestures (0.5), Verbal (0.5), Concentration (0.5)
**Cost Calculation**: Base 30 CP ÷ (1+1.5) = 12 CP → 15 CP with duration

**Effect**: 2d6 Reduce Body, Ranged 10m
**Limitations**: Gestures (0.5), Verbal (0.5), Skill Roll (0.5), Cool Down (1.0)
**Cost Calculation**: Base 72 CP ÷ (1+2.5) = 20.6 CP → 25 CP
**Description**: Compresses intense heat into a roiling sphere that launches toward the target in a spiraling trajectory. On impact, the orb detonates in a burst of searing flames. A workhorse battle spell that leaves the caster momentarily drained of power.

### 9. Frost Lance (25 CP)
**Category**: Attack
**Effect**: 2d6 Reduce Body, Ranged 10m
**Limitations**: Gestures (0.5), Verbal (0.5), Skill Roll (0.5), Cool Down (1.0)
**Cost Calculation**: Base 72 CP ÷ (1+2.5) = 20.6 CP → 25 CP
**Description**: Crystallizes moisture from the air into a spear of dense ice that hurtles toward its target. Mechanically identical to Burning Orb but manifests as bitter cold rather than heat. Some creatures prove more vulnerable to freezing than burning.

### 10. Thunder Strike (28 CP)
**Category**: Attack
**Effect**: 2d6+1 Reduce Body, Ranged 10m, Line effect
**Limitations**: Gestures (0.5), Verbal (0.5), Skill Roll (0.5), Cool Down (1.0)
**Cost Calculation**: Base 81 CP ÷ (1+2.5) = 23.1 CP → 28 CP

### 11. Temporal Rush (20 CP)
**Category**: Support
**Effect**: 1d6 Improve Action, Touch range
**Limitations**: Gestures (0.5), Verbal (0.5), Concentration (0.5), Cool Down (1.0)
**Cost Calculation**: Base 48 CP ÷ (1+2.0) = 16 CP → 20 CP
**Description**: Subtly accelerates the target's personal timeline, allowing them to move and react with supernatural speed. From the target's perspective, the world slows down; from observers' perspective, the target becomes a blur of motion. Sustaining the temporal distortion taxes the caster heavily.

### 12. Vital Restoration (18 CP)
**Category**: Support
**Effect**: 2d6 Improve Body, Touch range
**Limitations**: Gestures (0.5), Verbal (0.5), Skill Roll (0.5), Cool Down (1.0)
**Cost Calculation**: Base 54 CP ÷ (1+2.5) = 15.4 CP → 18 CP
**Description**: Channels pure life energy through the caster's hands into a wounded ally, knitting flesh and mending bone. The target's injuries close visibly as vitality flows into them. The magical exertion leaves the caster temporarily depleted.

### 13. Shadowblend (22 CP)

**Limitations**: Gestures (0.5), Verbal (0.5), Concentration (0.5), Breaks on attack (0.5)
**Cost Calculation**: Base 48 CP ÷ (1+2.0) = 24 CP → 22 CP with restrictions
**Description**: Weaves shadows and redirected light around the target, rendering them imperceptible to normal sight. The delicate magical pattern unravels instantly if the target makes any aggressive action, as violent intent disrupts the necessary concentration.

**Effect**: 2d6 Reduce Move, Ranged 10m, 3m Area
**Limitations**: Gestures (0.5), Verbal (0.5), Skill Roll (0.5)
**Cost Calculation**: Base 50 CP ÷ (1+1.5) = 20 CP
**Description**: Manifests a mass of sticky, rope-like tendrils that erupt from a point and ensnare everyone in the vicinity. The magical strands cling to armor, limbs, and weapons, severely hampering movement. They remain until physically destroyed, magically dispelled, or dismissed by the caster.

### 15. Aerial Grace (30 CP)
**Category**: Movement
**Effect**: 3d6 Move (Flight), Self only
**Limitations**: Gestures (0.5), Verbal (0.5), Concentration (0.5)
**Cost Calculation**: Base 60 CP ÷ (1+1.5) = 24 CP → 30 CP with good speed

The intense focus required leaves the caster magically depleted.

### 17. Mind's Grasp (28 CP)
**Category**: Utility
**Effect**: 3d6 Push, Ranged 10m
**Limitations**: Gestures (0.5), Concentration (0.5), Skill Roll (0.5)
**Cost Calculation**: Base 56 CP ÷ (1+1.5) = 22.4 CP → 28 CP

### 18. Iron Flesh (30 CP)
**Category**: Defense
**Effect**: 2d6 Improve Defense, Touch range
**Limitations**: Gestures (0.5), Verbal (0.5), Concentration (0.5)
**Cost Calculation**: Base 60 CP ÷ (1+1.5) = 24 CP → 30 CP
**Description**: Infuses the target's skin and muscle tissue with supernatural resilience, making their flesh as resistant as forged metal. Blades glance off, arrows deflect, and impacts that would shatter bones merely bruise. The enchantment requires constant concentration to sustain.

### 19. Dread Aura (22 CP)
**Category**: Control
**Effect**: 2d6 Reduce Accuracy, Ranged 10m, 3m Area
**Limitations**: Gestures (0.5), Verbal (0.5), Skill Roll (0.5)
**Cost Calculation**: Base 55 CP ÷ (1+1.5) = 22 CP
**Description**: Projects an aura of profound unease and supernatural dread that settles over all enemies in the vicinity. Hands tremble, focus wavers, and confidence evaporates, making coordinated attacks nearly impossible. The affected feel as if watched by something hungry and malevolent.

### 20. Distant Eye (24 CP)
**Category**: Utility
**Effect**: 3d6 Detect (General), Remote viewing, 100m range
**Limitations**: Concentration (0.5), Verbal (0.5), Stationary (0.5), Skill Roll (0.5)
**Cost Calculation**: Base 48 CP ÷ (1+2.0) = 24 CP
**Description**: Projects the caster's senses to a distant location, creating an invisible magical sensor that sees and hears everything nearby. The caster's eyes glaze over as their awareness transfers elsewhere. They must remain completely still and maintain a continuous whispered chant throughout the viewing.

### 21. Spell Snare (30 CP)
**Category**: Defense
**Effect**: 3d6 Resist Adjustment (Counter magic)
**Limitations**: Verbal (0.5), Requires timing (0.5), Skill Roll (0.5)
**Cost Calculation**: Base 75 CP ÷ (1+1.5) = 30 CP
**Description**: Intercepts enemy magic at the moment of casting, disrupting its formation with a precisely timed burst of counter-energy. The caster must recognize the spell being cast and speak the interruption formula at exactly the right instant—too early or too late and the opportunity passes.

### 22. Temporal Weight (28 CP)
**Category**: Control
**Effect**: 2d6 Reduce Action, Ranged 10m, 3m Area
**Limitations**: Gestures (0.5), Verbal (0.5), Skill Roll (0.5), Cool Down (1.0)
**Cost Calculation**: Base 84 CP ÷ (1+2.5) = 24 CP → 28 CP
**Description**: Distorts the flow of time around enemies, making them sluggish and ponderous. From their perspective, the world speeds up while they struggle through syrup; from outside, they appear to move in slow motion. Exceptionally effective for controlling groups, but magically exhausting to maintain.

### 23. Titan Form (18 CP)
**Category**: Support
**Effect**: 1d6 Improve Strength (represented as better damage), Touch range
**Limitations**: Gestures (0.5), Verbal (0.5), Concentration (0.5), Obvious effect (0.5)
**Cost Calculation**: Base 36 CP ÷ (1+2.0) = 12 CP → 18 CP with effects
**Description**: Causes the target to rapidly grow to twice their normal size, their muscles swelling with proportional might. Clothing and equipment magically resize along with them. The dramatic transformation makes any form of subtlety impossible—everyone notices a twelve-foot warrior stomping toward them.

**Limitations**: Gestures (0.5), Verbal (0.5), Skill Roll (0.5), Cool Down (1.0)
**Cost Calculation**: Base 135 CP ÷ (1+2.5) = 38.6 CP → 45 CP
**Description**: Unleashes a massive stroke of electrical energy that leaps from the primary target to nearby enemies, each arc as devastating as the last. The crackling discharge illuminates the battlefield and leaves the caster's hair standing on end. The most destructive spell for dealing with clustered foes, though it depletes magical reserves entirely.

### 25. Celestial Bombardment (50 CP)

**Effect**: 3d6 Reduce Body, Ranged 10m, 5m Area of Effect
**Limitations**: Gestures (0.5), Verbal (0.5), Skill Roll (0.5), Cool Down (1.0)

Reality ripples and distorts around both locations as space folds. An invaluable escape mechanism that nevertheless leaves the caster magically depleted.

### 27. Battle Shade (40 CP)
**Category**: Utility
**Effect**: 3d6 Signal (Suppress Light), Touch range
**Limitations**: Gestures (0.5), Verbal (0.5), Concentration (0.5)
**Cost Calculation**: Base 80 CP ÷ (1+1.5) = 32 CP → 40 CP with no break-on-attack
**Description**: An advanced form of concealment magic that maintains its effect even during combat. Unlike simpler invisibility, the Battle Shade weaves continuously to compensate for the target's movements and actions, allowing them to strike from concealment. Maintaining this intricate pattern demands intense, unwavering concentration.

### 28. Immutable Wall (42 CP)
**Category**: Defense
**Effect**: 3d6 Resist Push (Create barrier), Ranged 10m, Large wall
**Limitations**: Gestures (0.5), Concentration (0.5), Skill Roll (0.5)
**Cost Calculation**: Base 84 CP ÷ (1+1.5) = 33.6 CP → 42 CP with area

**Effect**: 3d6+1 Detect (All concealment), Self only
**Limitations**: Verbal (0.5), Concentration (0.5), Skill Roll (0.5)
**Cost Calculation**: Base 63 CP ÷ (1+1.5) = 25.2 CP → 36 CP with comprehensive detection
**Description**: Enhances the caster's vision to perceive the world as it truly is, piercing through invisibility, illusions, magical darkness, and all manner of concealment. The caster's eyes glow with an eerie light as they see the hidden made manifest. Requires continuous whispered incantations to maintain.

## Using This Grimoire

### Spell Selection for Characters

Characters should select spells appropriate to their CP budget and role:

- **Beginning Wizard (25 CP)**: 2-3 low tier spells (detection, utility, one attack)
- **Adventuring Wizard (50 CP)**: 4-6 spells spanning low and mid tier
- **Master Wizard (100 CP)**: 8-12 spells including high tier options
- **Archmage (200 CP)**: 15+ spells, multiple high tier options

### Customizing Spells

The Plasticine system encourages customization. Any spell can be modified by:

- **Changing special effects**: Burning Orb → Acid Sphere, Frozen Comet, Sonic Burst
- **Adjusting limitations**: Remove Cool Down (+cost), add Requires Material Component (−cost)
- **Changing range**: More range (+cost), touch only (−cost)
- **Adjusting area**: Larger area (+cost), single target (−cost)

### Spell Schools (Optional)

Using the System advantage (10 CP), wizards can specialize in schools of magic:

- **Evocation**: Attack spells (Spark, Aetheric Bolt, Burning Orb, Branching Arc, Celestial Bombardment, Thunder Strike)
- **Abjuration**: Defense spells (Warding Veil, Iron Flesh, Immutable Wall, Spell Snare, Unweaving)
- **Transmutation**: Alteration spells (Temporal Rush, Temporal Weight, Titan Form, Wind Cushion, Iron Flesh)
- **Conjuration**: Movement spells (Rift Step, Aerial Grace)
- **Illusion**: Concealment spells (Shadowblend, Battle Shade)
- **Divination**: Detection spells (Mystic Sense, Distant Eye, Piercing Gaze)
- **Enchantment**: Control spells (Dread Aura, Temporal Weight, Binding Strands)
- **Universal**: Utility spells (Minor Working, Luminary Orb, Mind's Grasp)

Specialists gain +1d6 when casting spells from their school but should focus their spell selection accordingly.

### Combat Considerations

- **Action Economy**: Spells with Cool Down exhaust magic for 3 actions—use them at critical moments
- **Concentration**: Many spells require concentration; you can only concentrate on one spell at a time
- **Skill Rolls**: Spells requiring skill rolls may fail; having a high Magic skill is essential
- **Positioning**: Area effects and line spells require tactical positioning
- **Resource Management**: Unlike systems with spell slots, Plasticine spells can be cast repeatedly, but Cool Down limits powerful spells

### Limitations Explained

- **Gestures**: Requires at least one free hand; impossible while bound
- **Verbal**: Requires speech; impossible while silenced or gagged
- **Concentration**: Breaks if you take damage or are distracted
- **Skill Roll**: Must succeed on Magic skill check or spell fails
- **Cool Down**: After casting, cannot cast any spells for your next 3 actions

## Designer Notes

This grimoire demonstrates Plasticine's flexible power system applied to classic fantasy magic. Key design principles:

1. **Balanced Costs**: Similar mechanical effects cost similar CP regardless of flavor (Burning Orb = Frost Lance)
2. **Tactical Choices**: Cool Down limitation makes powerful spells strategic choices
3. **Action Economy**: Concentration spells create meaningful trade-offs
4. **Scalability**: The same system works for 25 CP apprentices and 200 CP archmages
5. **Customization**: Every spell can be reskinned or modified using the core rules

The grimoire intentionally includes "system variants" (different damage types with identical costs) to show that special effects don't affect balance. A wizard hurling Burning Orbs is mechanically identical to one casting Frost Lances—the choice is about character concept, not optimization.

For more exotic spells or to create custom magic, use the core Plasticine power system: choose a base power (Adjust, Move, Push, Detect, Signal), add modifiers (range, area, duration), and apply limitations to reach your desired CP cost.
