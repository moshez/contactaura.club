The Convergence
===========================

A Planar Fantasy Setting for the Plasticine TTRPG System

Introduction
============

The Convergence is a fantasy setting where the Material Plane overlaps with other planes of existence, creating zones of strange power and impossible geography. Where these planes meet, reality bleeds together—doors lead to distant places, buildings grow like living things, and the very laws of nature shift beneath your feet.

This is a world of border cities where multiple realities converge, of merchants trading goods from other planes, of adventurers navigating dungeons where rooms rearrange themselves. It is a world where control of convergence zones means control of trade routes and food supplies, where planar natives walk the streets alongside humans, and where magic itself bends to the influence of overlapping realities.
