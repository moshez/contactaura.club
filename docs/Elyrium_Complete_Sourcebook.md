# Elyrium: A Complete Sourcebook

## Welcome to Elyrium

The merchant caravan had almost made it to Wheathold when the birds stopped singing. Elven traders knew this sign well—somewhere nearby, reality was growing thin. Sure enough, within hours, a shimmer appeared in the air near the road, like heat rising from summer stones. By nightfall, it had grown into a proper portal, its edges wavering uncertainly as it cast its peculiar light across the worried faces of the caravan guards. The elves simply adjusted their route, giving the phenomenon a wide berth as they guided their horses toward the distant glow of the human settlement. They knew better than to tempt the strange forces that wove through their world.

Welcome to Elyrium, a land where reality itself occasionally grows thin, giving birth to mysterious portals that dot the landscape like temporary doorways to elsewhere. These portals are more than mere curiosities—they are the threads that weave through every aspect of life in this realm, from the profession of specialized doll-makers who craft portal-closing simulacra, to the mages who draw power from the disturbances these phenomena create in the natural world.

In Elyrium, four great peoples shape civilization, each existing in complementary pairs that reflect deeper patterns within the world itself. The dynamic, innovative humans find their counterpart in the eternal, perfecting elves, while the monumental works of dwarven engineering complement the precise, intricate crafting of their gnomish kin. Each brings their own approach to the challenges and opportunities that portals present, from the elaborate tent cities of nomadic elves to the portal-resistant architecture of human settlements.

The magic of this realm flows in two distinct but interrelated streams. Rift Magic draws power from the very disturbances that give birth to portals, allowing its practitioners to bend reality in spectacular—if unpredictable—ways. In contrast, Balance Magic works through the enhancement of natural patterns and symmetries, its practitioners maintaining the delicate equilibrium that prevents portal-born chaos from overwhelming the world.

Yet it is perhaps the great beasts of Elyrium that best embody this eternal dance between chaos and order. Dragons, no larger than draft horses but no less magnificent for their size, are drawn to portal manifestations, their very presence causing reality to ripple and shift. Standing in opposition are the Giant Balance Bears, massive guardians of natural harmony that can rise to fourteen feet on their hind legs, actively protecting areas where the world's patterns flow undisturbed.

This is a world where reality itself is negotiable, where the boundaries between what is and what might be grow thin without warning. Whether you're a human farmer installing portal-resistant fencing around your fields, an elven trader plotting routes between stable territories, a dwarven engineer designing halls to withstand reality's fluctuations, or a gnomish artisan crafting delicate instruments to measure portal activity, you are part of the great tapestry that is Elyrium—a realm where the only constant is change itself, yet where ancient patterns endure through every transformation.

The pages that follow will guide you through this remarkable world, from the practical concerns of daily life in portal-touched lands to the deepest mysteries of Rift and Balance Magic. Welcome, traveler, to a realm where reality is not quite as solid as it seems, and where adventure lurks behind every ripple in the fabric of existence.

## Core World Elements

### Portals

Throughout the lands of Elyrium, reality itself sometimes grows thin, giving birth to phenomena known simply as portals. These mysterious apertures in the fabric of existence appear without warning, their emergence heralded by subtle disturbances in the natural world—birds falling silent, plants growing in unusual patterns, and the air itself taking on a peculiar weight that sensitive individuals can feel days before a portal manifests.

#### Nature and Appearance

To the untrained eye, a portal might first appear as nothing more than a shimmer in the air, like heat rising from sun-baked stones. As it stabilizes, it typically develops into a roughly oval opening, ranging from the size of a doorway to that of a farmer's cart. The borders of these portals often exhibit a characteristic wavering, as though the very air around them is uncertain of its place in the world.

While each portal is unique, most share certain common traits: a faint luminescence that seems to come from everywhere and nowhere at once, a subtle distortion of sound in their immediate vicinity, and what many describe as a "pulling sensation" that grows stronger as one draws near.

#### Environmental Impact

The presence of a portal invariably affects its surroundings. Within a radius roughly proportional to the portal's size (typically 20 to 50 paces), the natural world begins to exhibit peculiar behaviors:
- Plants may grow at accelerated rates or in unusual patterns
- Animals often become agitated or avoid the area entirely
- Weather phenomena can become localized and unpredictable
- Rift magic practitioners report enhanced abilities, though with decreased predictability

#### The Mystery of Closure

Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of portals is their relationship with sapient passage. Each time a person—whether human, elf, dwarf, or gnome—passes through a portal, it becomes slightly more stable—yet paradoxically, this increased stability hastens its eventual closure. This phenomenon has led to the development of one of Elyrium's most unique industries: the crafting of portal-closing dolls.

##### The Doll-Makers' Art

The creation of portal-closing dolls has evolved into a sophisticated craft, combining artistry with practical necessity. These dolls must approximate humanoid form closely enough to trigger the portal's stability mechanism, yet be distinct enough to avoid unwanted magical resonances. Master doll-makers are highly respected artisans who often incorporate materials gathered from near the portal they're meant to close, believing this increases their effectiveness.

Different cultures approach doll-making with their own traditions:
- Human craftsmen favor carved wooden dolls with articulated joints
- Elven artisans create intricate dolls woven from horsehair and blessed threads
- Dwarven makers construct sturdy metallic figures with precise mechanical movements
- Gnomish crafters specialize in miniature automated dolls with clockwork components

#### Cultural Significance

The approach to portal management varies significantly across cultures and regions. Some communities view portals as opportunities, establishing settlements near common manifestation points to harvest their magical energies or profit from travelers seeking passage. Others see them as dangers to be closed as quickly as possible, maintaining stores of closing dolls and supporting specialized portal-watching guilds.

#### Theoretical Understanding

Despite centuries of study, the true nature of portals remains a subject of debate among scholars. Some theorize they are natural phenomena, like springs of magical energy bubbling up from some deeper reality. Others suggest they are echoes of an ancient network of travel ways, degrading over time. The most controversial theories propose they are communications from some intelligence beyond our understanding, though to what end remains unclear.

What is known with certainty is their integral role in shaping Elyrium's society, from the architecture of cities (which often incorporates portal-resistant designs) to the development of specialized magical practices and crafting traditions. They remain one of the defining features of this world, a constant reminder that reality itself is perhaps more mutable than it appears.

### Sapient Species

Exist in complementary pairs:

#### Humans & Elves

##### Children of Innovation (Humans)

Humans embody the dynamic principle of change. Where they settle, the world transforms—forests become farmland, hills sprout villages, and rivers bend to the will of their water wheels. Their relatively brief lives (rarely exceeding eight decades) drive them to create lasting legacies through their works and their numerous children. A human settlement can double in size within a generation, and their innovations in farming, crafting, and social organization emerge with similar speed.

This dynamism carries a price: human works often lack the refinement of their longer-lived kin, and their settlements can feel perpetually unfinished, caught in an endless cycle of expansion and renovation. Yet it is precisely this imperfection that drives them forward, each generation building upon—or sometimes deliberately breaking from—the achievements of their ancestors.

**Primary Focus:** Agriculture and village-based crafts

**Lifestyle:**
- Settled in permanent villages
- Live in wooden or stone houses
- Community-centered with shared facilities

**Specialties:**
- Farming (wheat, vegetables, fruits)
- Animal husbandry (primarily chickens)
- Light crafts (leatherworking, sewing)
- Food preservation and processing

##### Eternal Wanderers (Elves)

In contrast, the elves embody persistence and perfection. Their nomadic lifestyle, maintained over lifespans that can stretch beyond three centuries, reflects a different understanding of legacy. Where humans build permanent structures, elves create mobile cities of stunning complexity, their tents and wagons representing generations of refined design.

Elven children are rare, with births often separated by decades. Each child receives years of careful instruction, not merely in practical skills but in the complex oral histories that bind their clan-based society together. An elven craftsperson might spend fifty years perfecting a single technique, achieving a level of mastery that shorter-lived peoples can only dream of.

**Primary Focus:** Trading and livestock herding

**Lifestyle:**
- Nomadic or semi-nomadic
- Live in elaborate tent cities that move seasonally
- Clan-based social structure

**Specialties:**
- Horse breeding and training
- Cattle and sheep herding
- Long-distance trade
- Caravan organization
- Wool and leather processing

##### The Myth of Half-Breeds

Despite what romantic tales might suggest, humans and elves cannot produce true hybrid offspring. Children of such unions (which are rare but not unheard of) strongly favor one ancestral line over the other, though they may carry subtle marks of their mixed heritage—a human child with unusual longevity, or an elf with a particular aptitude for innovation.

#### Dwarves & Gnomes

##### Masters of the Mountain (Dwarves)

Dwarven civilization is built on a foundation of monumental works. Their underground cities are marvels of engineering, with halls vast enough to house entire surface villages and systems of ventilation and water management that function flawlessly for centuries. Their forges produce tools and structures of staggering size and durability, from mining equipment that can crack mountains to gates that can withstand sieges.

This focus on the massive and enduring shapes every aspect of dwarven society. Their communities are organized around large-scale projects that may span generations, with intricate systems of apprenticeship ensuring that vital knowledge is preserved and expanded upon. Even their art tends toward the grand—massive murals carved into cave walls, sculptures that double as support columns, and songs meant to be sung by hundreds of voices echoing through their great halls.

**Primary Focus:** Mining and raw material extraction

**Lifestyle:**
- Underground settlements
- Live in carved cave-cities near mines
- Highly organized work structures

**Specialties:**
- Metal ore extraction
- Gem mining
- Mining tool creation and maintenance
- Underground architecture
- Tunnel engineering

##### Precision's Children (Gnomes)

Where dwarves master the monumental, gnomes pursue the minute and precise. Their settlements, often built alongside human villages or near dwarven cities, are distinguished by workshops filled with tools of incredible delicacy. A gnomish craftsperson might spend months crafting a timepiece smaller than a thumbnail, or years developing a new technique for cutting gems to catch light in previously impossible ways.

This mastery of fine detail extends beyond mere crafting. Gnomish communities are marvels of efficient organization, with complex systems of mutual support and resource sharing that allow them to thrive despite their small numbers. Their innovations in precision mechanics have revolutionized everything from locksmithing to astronomy, though they rely on their dwarven cousins for the raw materials their work requires.

**Primary Focus:** Metalworking and fine crafting

**Lifestyle:**
- Settled in brick houses
- Often near human settlements
- Workshop-centered communities

**Specialties:**
- Smithing (both practical and decorative)
- Jewelry making
- Tool crafting
- Precision instruments
- Mechanical innovations

##### The Power of Partnership

The complementary nature of dwarven and gnomish crafting has led to some of Elyrium's most impressive achievements. Major projects often see the two peoples working in concert, with dwarven mastery of large-scale engineering providing the framework for gnomish precision mechanisms. The great gates of dwarven cities, for instance, often house gnome-crafted locking mechanisms of such complexity that they're considered works of art in their own right.

#### Cultural Interplay

While each species maintains its distinct traditions and tendencies, the four peoples of Elyrium have developed complex patterns of interaction and mutual dependence. Human agricultural abundance feeds gnomish workshops, while elven trading caravans ensure that dwarven crafts reach distant markets. These relationships have evolved over centuries into a resilient social fabric that defines Elyrium's civilization.

Understanding these species and their relationships is crucial for anyone seeking to navigate Elyrium's social landscape. Each brings unique strengths and perspectives to any endeavor, and the wisest leaders learn to leverage these differences rather than trying to overcome them.

### Economic Systems

Regions in Elyrium operate on complex webs of interdependence, with each species and settlement providing essential services and goods. Currency exists but barter remains common, especially in smaller transactions. Major trade goods include:

#### Primary Resources
- Metals (copper, iron, trace precious metals)
- Agricultural products (grain, vegetables, eggs)
- Livestock products (meat, wool, leather)
- Crafted goods (tools, jewelry, household items)

#### Common Trade Patterns
- Elven traders serve as primary facilitators of inter-settlement commerce
- Weekly markets in human villages
- Monthly larger trade gatherings rotating between settlements
- Seasonal grand markets coinciding with elven camp movements

### Major Monsters

Among the many wonders and dangers that populate the lands of Elyrium, two creatures stand above all others in their significance and power: the reality-warping Dragons and the harmony-preserving Giant Balance Bears. These beings are not mere beasts, but rather embodiments of the world's fundamental forces, each representing one side of Elyrium's eternal dance between chaos and order.

#### Dragons: Harbingers of Change

Unlike the mythical wyrms of fairy tales that dwarf entire castles, the dragons of Elyrium are more modest in size—though no less magnificent or dangerous. Standing roughly six to seven feet at the shoulder, they possess a compact power that makes them no less lethal than their legendary cousins.

These creatures are intrinsically linked to the portal phenomena that shape Elyrium's landscape. Just as portals represent tears in reality's fabric, dragons seem to carry disruption in their wake, their very presence causing subtle distortions in the natural order. Scholars have long debated whether dragons are drawn to portal manifestations or if their presence somehow catalyzes portal formation—a chicken-and-egg conundrum that remains unresolved.

##### Physical Characteristics
A typical dragon combines serpentine grace with predatory power. Their scales shift colors in response to their surroundings, not for camouflage but as a visible manifestation of their reality-warping nature. Their eyes possess a disconcerting depth, seeming to look not just at observers but through them, perhaps perceiving layers of reality invisible to mortal sight.

##### Intelligence and Motivation
Dragons possess an intelligence that defies conventional understanding. They can comprehend and even communicate in mortal languages when they choose, but their thought patterns follow alien paths. Their concerns center around cosmic imbalances and reality fluctuations that most mortals cannot perceive. This makes them simultaneously more and less dangerous than mindless beasts—while they can sometimes be reasoned with, their motivations may be entirely incomprehensible to mortal minds.

##### Combat and Confrontation
While formidable, dragons are not invincible. A well-prepared group of adventurers, armed with knowledge of draconic behavior and appropriate weaponry, can successfully defend against or even defeat one. However, such victories often come at great cost, as dragons instinctively manipulate local reality during combat, causing unpredictable effects that can persist long after the battle ends.

#### Giant Balance Bears: Guardians of Harmony

Standing as nature's answer to draconic chaos, Giant Balance Bears represent the ordering force of the natural world. These massive creatures, reaching up to fourteen feet when standing on their hind legs, serve as living embodiments of natural harmony.

Unlike their smaller cousins, Giant Balance Bears possess a deep connection to the fundamental patterns that Balance Magic practitioners study and maintain. They actively seek out and protect areas of natural harmony, often establishing territories around locations where the world's natural rhythms flow most strongly.

##### Physical Characteristics
Giant Balance Bears possess thick, luxuriant fur that changes color with the seasons, perfectly matching the natural cycles of their territory. Their enormous size belies a surprising grace, and they move through even dense forest without disturbing the surrounding vegetation. Most distinctive are their eyes, which shimmer with an inner light that Balance Magic practitioners claim reflects the very essence of natural harmony.

##### Intelligence and Motivation
These creatures possess an intelligence different from but no less sophisticated than that of dragons. While they can't speak mortal languages, they demonstrate complex problem-solving abilities and an uncanny awareness of ecological relationships. Their primary drive appears to be the maintenance of natural patterns and the protection of harmonious spaces from both mortal disruption and portal-related instability.

##### Interaction and Confrontation
While Giant Balance Bears generally prefer to avoid conflict, they will react decisively to threats against their protected territories. They are particularly hostile toward dragons and often respond aggressively to the use of Rift Magic within their domains. However, they can display remarkable restraint when dealing with mortals who show respect for natural harmony, and there are documented cases of Balance Magic practitioners developing cooperative relationships with these magnificent creatures.

#### Role in Elyrium's Ecology

The interaction between dragons and Giant Balance Bears reflects the larger patterns of Elyrium itself. Their natural antipathy toward each other helps maintain a crucial equilibrium—dragons prevent the world from becoming too rigid and unchanging, while Balance Bears ensure that chaos doesn't overwhelm natural order entirely.

This delicate balance makes both creatures essential to Elyrium's ecology, despite the dangers they sometimes pose to mortal communities. Understanding and respecting their roles is crucial for anyone traveling through Elyrium's wilder regions, where encounters with these beings, while rare, remain a very real possibility.

For adventurers and scholars alike, these creatures represent both peril and opportunity. A dragon might be reasoned with to gain insight into reality's deeper workings, while a Giant Balance Bear might be cautiously approached for guidance in finding places of natural power. In either case, respect and preparation are essential—these are not mere beasts to be hunted, but fundamental forces of nature given physical form.

### Religion & Mythology
- Varies by culture and region
- No direct divine intervention
- Different species have different interpretations
- Religious beliefs separate from magical practice
- Gods may or may not exist
- Faith is a matter of belief rather than empirical evidence

## Regional Example: The Sunset Accord

The Sunset Accord is a loose confederation of settlements in the southwestern frontier of the known world. Bordered by wilderness on three sides and ocean to the west, this region exemplifies cooperation between the four peoples of Elyrium.

## Magic Systems

In Elyrium, magic manifests in two distinct but interrelated forms: the dynamic power of Rift Magic and the subtle influence of Balance Magic. These two systems represent fundamental forces within the world, each drawing upon different aspects of reality and requiring distinct approaches to their mastery.

### Rift Magic: Power from Chaos

Rift Magic draws its strength from the very disturbances in reality that give birth to portals. Practitioners of this art—commonly known as mages—learn to harness the invisible currents of disrupted natural law that emanate from these tears in the world's fabric. Their power waxes and wanes with the proximity of portals and the general stability of their surroundings.

#### Nature of the Power
At its core, Rift Magic represents possibility unbound by natural law. Just as portals create spaces where reality grows thin, Rift Magic allows its practitioners to bend or temporarily suspend the normal rules that govern the world. This power comes with considerable risk—like the portals themselves, Rift Magic can be unpredictable and difficult to control fully.

The visible manifestation of Rift Magic often mirrors the distortion effects seen around portals: shimmering air, distorted sounds, and a palpable sense of reality straining against its bounds. More powerful workings may produce effects similar to portal manifestation zones, causing temporary disruptions in local weather patterns or unusual behavior in nearby plant and animal life.

#### Practitioners and Training
Those who wish to master Rift Magic must develop an intimate understanding of both portals and the nature of reality's boundaries. Training typically begins with extensive study of portal phenomena, often requiring apprentice mages to spend months or years observing and documenting portal manifestations and their effects on the surrounding environment.

Most mages maintain detailed records of portal appearances and behavior patterns in their regions, sharing this information through complex networks of correspondence and regular gatherings. This knowledge serves both practical and theoretical purposes, helping them predict where their powers will be strongest and contributing to the broader understanding of portal mechanics.

#### Limitations and Strengths
The power of Rift Magic is inversely proportional to the stability of the local environment. In areas of natural harmony, particularly those favored by practitioners of Balance Magic, Rift Magic becomes more difficult to control and less reliable. Conversely, in regions with active portals or recent portal activity, Rift Magic can achieve effects that would be impossible elsewhere.

The most powerful Rift Magic tends to be temporary in nature—like the portals themselves, major workings eventually collapse back into normal reality. However, skilled mages can achieve spectacular effects while their power holds, from dramatic environmental manipulations to temporary suspensions of fundamental natural laws.

#### Combat Spells

**Reality Shard**
* Cast Time: 1 second
* Range: 40 feet
* Duration: Instant
* Components: A splinter from a portal-closing doll
* Effect: Launches 3 crystals of portal energy
* Damage: Physical/Energy hybrid
* Special: Affects ethereal creatures normally

The caster crystallizes ambient portal energy into deadly shards of semi-real matter. These translucent crystals shimmer with an inner light and pass through conventional armor as if it weren't there. Most unsettling to witnesses is the way the shards seem to exist in slightly different locations than where they visually appear, making them nearly impossible to dodge.

First-year students are strictly forbidden from attempting this spell near active portals, after the infamous "Triple Echo Incident" that took three weeks to clean up.

**Chaotic Burst**
* Cast Time: 1 second
* Range: 60 feet
* Duration: Instant
* Components: A handful of dust from near a portal
* Effect: 15-foot explosion of warped space
* Damage: Force damage + random displacement
* Special: 25% chance to create temporary portal echoes

By concentrating portal distortion into a single point and then releasing it explosively, the caster creates a sphere of pure chaos. Space itself rebels within the affected area, simultaneously trying to occupy multiple configurations. The results are as spectacular as they are unpredictable - targets might be crushed, stretched, or thrown in random directions.

Veteran mages joke that you haven't truly mastered this spell until you've accidentally thrown yourself through your own ceiling at least once.

**Gravity Crush**
* Cast Time: 1 second
* Range: 30 feet
* Duration: 10 seconds
* Components: A small lead weight
* Effect: Creates 10-foot sphere of intensified gravity
* Damage: Ongoing crushing damage
* Special: Reduces movement speed by 75%

By manipulating the way portal energy distorts space, the caster creates a zone of intensified gravitational force. The effect is precise enough to target enemies while leaving allies unaffected, though experienced mages warn that this distinction requires absolute concentration to maintain.

The spell was originally developed for mining operations, until its combat applications became obvious during an unfortunate bandit raid on an experimental mining site.

**Entropy Beam**
* Cast Time: 1 second
* Range: 30 feet
* Duration: Instant
* Components: A pinch of rust
* Effect: Rapid aging/decay beam
* Damage: Decay damage + armor degradation
* Special: Double damage to constructed objects

Drawing on the way portals warp time as well as space, this spell concentrates temporal entropy into a focused beam. The effect causes metal to rust, wood to rot, and living tissue to briefly experience years of aging in seconds. While the aging effect on living beings reverses itself quickly, the damage to inanimate objects is permanent.

The spell's inventor maintains that discovering its effects on armor was purely accidental, having originally designed it for rapid composting.

**Space Rip**
* Cast Time: 1 second
* Range: 20 feet
* Duration: Instant
* Components: A torn piece of parchment
* Effect: Creates line of spatial distortion
* Damage: Slashing damage to all in line
* Special: Can cut through physical barriers

By tearing the fabric of space itself, the caster creates a momentary line of spatial separation. Anything caught in this line experiences the unique sensation of being simultaneously on both sides of the tear. While the effect is brief, it is extremely effective at bypassing conventional defenses.

Spatial containment specialists particularly hate cleaning up after inexperienced casters attempt this spell, as the residual spatial distortions can cause objects to randomly swap places for days afterward.

**Distortion Field**
* Cast Time: 1 second
* Range: Self
* Duration: 30 seconds
* Components: A warped piece of glass
* Effect: Creates 15-foot zone of warped space
* Defense: 50% miss chance on ranged attacks
* Special: Disrupts enemy movement

The caster creates a bubble of warped space around themselves where straight lines become curves and parallel lines inevitably intersect. While this makes it difficult for enemies to land ranged attacks, it also tends to disorient allies, leading experienced mages to warn against its use in formation fighting.

The spell was discovered accidentally when a portal researcher noticed that her laboratory's persistent spatial distortions were causing assistant's thrown papers to consistently miss the waste basket.

**Portal Pulse**
* Cast Time: 1 second
* Range: 20-foot radius
* Duration: Instant
* Components: Portal residue
* Effect: Omnidirectional portal energy wave
* Damage: Energy damage + magic disruption
* Special: Can destabilize existing portals

By releasing raw portal energy in a controlled wave, the caster creates a pulse that disrupts both conventional magic and portal-based effects. While effective, the spell is notorious for its tendency to cause lingering spatial hiccups in the affected area.

Most schools of portal magic teach this spell with the caveat "not to be used in libraries, laboratories, or anywhere you might want to find things in the same place you left them."

**Void Touch**
* Cast Time: 1 second
* Range: Touch
* Duration: 10 seconds
* Components: A shadow gathered at midnight
* Effect: Partially phases target out of reality
* Special: Target takes 50% extra damage
* Warning: Can bypass physical barriers

By reaching through the spaces between spaces, the caster partially phases a target out of normal reality. This leaves the target existing in multiple possible states simultaneously, making them particularly vulnerable to further damage. The spell requires extreme precision, as an improperly calibrated phase state can have unpredictable results.

The spell's creator famously demonstrated its effectiveness by reaching through their academy's treasury wall. They spent the next decade developing it into a proper combat technique to reduce their sentenced time.

#### Utility Spells

**Reality Anchor**
* Cast Time: 1 minute
* Range: 30-foot radius
* Duration: 1 hour
* Components: A portal-closing doll, powdered silver
* Effect: Stabilizes area against portal formation
* Special: Suppresses portal creature powers

This ritual temporarily stabilizes an area against portal formation and related phenomena. The effect is particularly useful when dealing with portal creatures or when working in areas prone to spontaneous portal manifestation. The spell requires careful setup and precise geometric patterns drawn in powdered silver.

The technique was developed by early portal researchers who needed a way to study portal phenomena without having their laboratories randomly relocate mid-experiment.

**Spatial Attunement**
* Cast Time: 1 minute
* Range: Self
* Duration: 1 hour
* Components: A crystal grown in portal energy
* Effect: Detect portal activity and disturbances
* Special: Can predict portal formations

Through careful attunement to local spatial distortions, the caster becomes aware of portal activity in their vicinity. Experienced practitioners can even predict likely locations of future portal manifestations, though this remains more art than science.

Most portal researchers consider this spell essential to their work, though they warn newcomers about the headache-inducing effect of maintaining the awareness for too long.

*"Remember, initiates: just because you can tear holes in reality doesn't mean you should. Portals have rules. Learn them, respect them, or spend the rest of your career cleaning up reality leaks."* 
- Standard warning given to new students of Rift Magic

### Balance Magic: The Power of Harmony

Where Rift Magic draws power from disruption, Balance Magic harnesses the natural patterns and symmetries woven into the fabric of reality. Its practitioners—typically called druids—work to understand and maintain these patterns, drawing power from the inherent harmony of undisturbed natural spaces.

#### Nature of the Power
Balance Magic manifests through the enhancement and manipulation of existing natural patterns. Rather than imposing change from outside, druids learn to work within the framework of nature's own systems. Their magic tends to be subtle but profound, capable of influencing weather patterns, accelerating or slowing natural processes, and maintaining harmony between different aspects of the natural world.

The visible effects of Balance Magic are often difficult to distinguish from natural phenomena—a timely rain shower, an unusually bountiful harvest, or the swift healing of a wounded animal might all be the work of a skilled druid. This subtlety is considered a mark of mastery; the most accomplished practitioners pride themselves on achieving their goals without leaving obvious signs of magical intervention.

#### Practitioners and Training
Druidic training emphasizes patience and observation above all else. Apprentices typically spend years learning to recognize and understand natural patterns before they begin any actual magical practice. This training often takes place in remote areas, far from the disrupting influence of portals and civilization.

Many druids maintain sacred spaces—areas of particular natural harmony where Balance Magic flows most freely. These locations serve as training grounds, gathering places, and reservoirs of power that can be drawn upon in times of need. The protection of these spaces from portal manifestations and other disruptions is a primary concern of the druidic community.

#### Limitations and Strengths
Balance Magic is at its strongest in naturally harmonious environments, particularly ancient forests, undisturbed mountains, and other locations where natural patterns have developed undisturbed over long periods. In areas disrupted by portals or extensive human development, Balance Magic becomes more difficult to access and control.

While lacking the spectacular immediate effects of Rift Magic, Balance Magic excels at creating lasting changes through the careful manipulation of natural systems. A skilled druid can influence regional weather patterns, guide the growth of plants and animals over generations, and maintain the health of entire ecosystems.

#### Combat Spells

**Nature's Grasp**
* Cast Time: 1 second
* Range: 30 feet
* Duration: 6 seconds
* Components: A living seed or root
* Effect: Rapidly growing roots entangle targets
* Damage: Crushing damage + immobilization
* Special: Creates difficult terrain for 1 minute

By awakening the dormant growth potential in nearby plants, the caster creates an explosive surge of vegetative growth. The resulting tangle of roots and vines seeks out targets with an almost predatory intelligence, though druids insist this is merely nature's inherent tendency to fill available space.

Students are advised to practice this spell well away from formal gardens, after the "Topiary Rebellion" incident at the High Druid's residence.

**Predator's Might**
* Cast Time: 1 second
* Range: Self
* Duration: 30 seconds
* Components: A predator's claw or fang
* Effect: Enhanced physical attacks + bleeding
* Special: Grants enhanced sense of prey's weaknesses
* Warning: May cause temporary aggressive tendencies

Drawing upon the essence of natural hunters, the caster channels primal predatory instincts into themselves. The spell grants not just enhanced strength but also the innate understanding of how to best use it. The resulting state of mind can be disconcerting to the unprepared.

More than one novice has found themselves instinctively chasing small animals while under the spell's influence. The High Circle now mandates a full meal before practice sessions.

**Lightning Strike**
* Cast Time: 1 second
* Range: 50 feet
* Duration: Instant
* Components: A piece of storm-struck wood
* Effect: Calls down natural lightning
* Damage: Electrical damage
* Special: Chains between wet targets

Rather than creating lightning, this spell guides natural electrical potentials already present in the atmosphere. The effect is particularly potent during storms but can be used even in clear weather by drawing upon the constant electrical charge present in the air.

Originally developed for agricultural purposes - nothing enriches soil quite like a lightning strike - until a druid noticed how effectively it cleared wild boars from her garden.

**Swarm Cloud**
* Cast Time: 1 second
* Range: 40 feet
* Duration: 20 seconds
* Components: A handful of living insects
* Effect: Summons biting/stinging swarm
* Damage: Ongoing damage + distraction
* Special: Swarm follows natural insect behavior

The caster establishes a temporary resonance with local insect life, drawing them into a coordinated swarm. The insects remain true to their nature - bees sting, ants bite, wasps harass - but act with unusual coordination. The spell works best in areas with healthy insect populations.

A famous druid once ended a siege by combining this spell with carefully preserved wasp nests. The attacking army's "tactical withdrawal" set new speed records.

**Stone Spear**
* Cast Time: 1 second
* Range: 60 feet
* Duration: Instant
* Components: A sharp stone
* Effect: Launches earthen projectiles
* Damage: Physical piercing damage
* Special: Launched stones can be recovered and reused

By accelerating the natural erosion and movement of stone, the caster shapes and launches razor-sharp projections of rock. The spell is particularly effective when cast on naturally occurring stone rather than worked masonry.

The technique was discovered by a druid studying how tree roots slowly crack and move stones, who wondered what would happen if the process was greatly accelerated.

**Bark Shield**
* Cast Time: 1 second
* Range: Touch
* Duration: 5 minutes
* Components: A piece of fresh bark
* Effect: Skin hardens like living wood
* Defense: Reduces physical damage by 50%
* Special: Still flexible at natural body joints

Mimicking the protective layers of ancient trees, this spell transforms the target's skin into a bark-like substance while maintaining flexibility. The effect gradually adapts to the wearer's movement, though many report an initial period of stiffness.

Druids advise against scratching while the spell is active, as bark-hardened fingernails can leave rather permanent grooves.

**Thorn Burst**
* Cast Time: 1 second
* Range: 20-foot radius
* Duration: 30 seconds
* Components: A thorn or spike
* Effect: Explosive growth of thorny vegetation
* Damage: Initial burst + ongoing to those who move through it
* Special: Creates natural barrier

Drawing upon plants' defensive mechanisms, the caster creates a sudden growth of thorns and brambles. The resulting barrier follows natural growth patterns, making it particularly stable and difficult to simply dispel.

The spell gained popularity among druids tasked with protecting orchards from fruit thieves, though some argue the punishment somewhat exceeds the crime.

**Life Flow**
* Cast Time: 1 second
* Range: Touch
* Duration: Instant
* Components: Fresh springwater
* Effect: Accelerates natural healing
* Healing: Restores 50% of missing health
* Special: Only affects living beings

By strengthening and accelerating natural healing processes, this spell can repair grievous injuries in moments. However, it can only work with the target's own healing capabilities - it cannot regenerate what nature would not heal on its own.

The spell's effectiveness on plants led to its widespread use in agriculture before its combat applications were fully realized.

#### Utility Spells

**Wild Communion**
* Cast Time: 1 minute
* Range: 60-foot radius
* Duration: 30 minutes
* Components: An offering of food appropriate to local wildlife
* Effect: Communicate with natural animals
* Special: Animals retain their natural instincts and intelligence

This ritual establishes a deeper connection with nearby wildlife, allowing for basic communication. While animals cannot express complex abstract thoughts, they can share what they have observed and respond to simple requests that align with their natural behaviors.

Most practitioners learn early on that animals are considerably more sarcastic than traditional tales would suggest.

**Earth Meld**
* Cast Time: 1 minute
* Range: Self
* Duration: 1 hour
* Components: Soil from the local area
* Effect: Merge with natural terrain
* Special: Grants awareness of anything touching the ground
* Warning: May cause temporary disorientation

By attuning completely with the natural environment, the caster can become one with the earth and its plant life. While merged, they gain an intimate awareness of their surroundings through the interconnected web of roots and soil.

The technique was discovered by a druid who fell asleep during a particularly long meditation session and woke up half-transformed into a shrub.

*"Nature does not solve problems with force when patience will serve. Learn from this. However, when nature does choose to act decisively - such as with lightning strikes or predator's claws - learn from that as well."*
- Traditional advice given to apprentice druids

### Interaction Between Systems

The relationship between Rift and Balance Magic mirrors the fundamental tensions within Elyrium itself. Each system weakens the other, yet both are necessary for the world's functioning. Portals and their associated disruptions create opportunities for change and progress, while the stabilizing influence of natural harmony prevents these changes from becoming too extreme or destructive.

Some theoretical practitioners study the interaction between these systems, seeking ways to combine their benefits or mitigate their mutual interference. While such research has produced interesting insights, true synthesis of the two forms of magic remains elusive—perhaps necessarily so.

Understanding these magical systems is crucial for anyone seeking to fully comprehend the nature of Elyrium. They represent not merely tools for achieving particular effects, but fundamental aspects of how the world functions and maintains its delicate balance between chaos and order, change and stability.

## Governance and Commerce

*"Four peoples, four perspectives—yet one market, one coin, one common cause. This is how we survive in a world where reality itself proves fickle."* 
- Eldara Swifttrade, Senior Caravanmaster of WindRunner Camp

### Confederate Governance

Throughout Elyrium, the challenges posed by portal manifestations have led most regions to adopt similar patterns of cooperative governance. While individual territories may vary in their specific implementations, most follow what has become known as the Confederate Model.

#### The Confederate Model

Under this system, settlements of all four peoples maintain individual autonomy while participating in mutual defense and infrastructure projects. This arrangement arose naturally from the early days of portal manifestation, when it became clear that no single species possessed all the skills necessary to thrive in a portal-touched world.

The relationship between settlements typically follows established patterns:
- Human villages provide agricultural stability and basic crafts
- Elven camps manage trade routes and livestock
- Dwarven mines extract raw materials
- Gnomish settlements provide specialized crafting and currency minting

#### Local Leadership

Each settlement, regardless of species, selects its own leader through methods appropriate to their traditions:
- Human villages typically hold open elections every 3-5 years
- Elven camps often choose leaders based on consensus among family heads
- Dwarven mines select leaders through merit-based competition
- Gnomish settlements frequently rotate leadership among master craftsmen

These local leaders meet regularly (often monthly) to coordinate regional responses to threats and manage shared resources. While the format of these meetings varies by region, they typically rotate between settlements to maintain equality among the peoples.

### Taxation and Commerce

*"Why do we mint the coins? Because someone has to, and precision is what we do best."*
- Master Coinsmith Glittergear of Silver Spire

#### The Export Tax System

Rather than attempting to tax all commerce—a practical impossibility given the mobile nature of elven camps and the complexity of inter-settlement trade—most confederations have adopted a streamlined approach focusing on exports.

The standard rate in most regions is the "trader's tenth":
- 10% of goods acquired within the confederation must be paid before export
- Payment must be made in gnome-minted coinage
- Local variations exist, but rarely exceed 12% or fall below 8%

This system arose naturally from the elven trading caravans' role in connecting the various settlements. As the primary movers of goods between communities, they became the logical point of taxation.

#### Currency and Coinage

The gnomish peoples' natural affinity for precision work has made them the de facto minters of coin throughout most of Elyrium. Their marked and weighted coins have become the standard currency for several practical reasons:
- Consistent weight and purity
- Difficult-to-counterfeit markings
- Widespread acceptance due to tax requirements

**Standard Denominations:**
- Copper Piece (CP): Standard unit, represents about a day's labor
- Silver Piece (SP): Worth 10 CP, standard unit for significant trades
- Gold Piece (GP): Worth 100 SP, used primarily for major transactions

#### The Minting Fee

Gnomish settlements charge a small fee (typically 1%) for converting raw metal or unmarked coins into official coinage. This "minter's share" serves several purposes:
- Compensates for the precision work involved
- Maintains the minting infrastructure
- Ensures quality control in the money supply

While some initially resisted this fee, it has proven considerably lower than the cost of determining metal purity and weight for each transaction independently.

### Public Works and Portal Management

*"A well-placed doll today prevents a reality breach tomorrow. Money well spent, I'd say."*
- Council-Chief Wheatwright of Sunreach

#### Community Projects

Tax revenues primarily fund projects benefiting the entire confederation:
- Portal management (doll commissioning and deployment)
- Road maintenance between settlements
- Bridge construction and repair
- Common defense arrangements
- Emergency response to portal-related crises

#### Portal Response Protocol

Most confederations maintain a standard response protocol for problematic portal manifestations:
1. Assessment by local portal watchers
2. Recommendation for closure or monitoring
3. If closure is recommended:
   - Fund raised from general tax revenue
   - Doll commissioned from appropriate craftsmen
   - Deployment coordinated between settlements

#### Budget Allocation

While specific allocations vary by region and immediate needs, most confederations follow similar patterns:
- 40% Portal management and response
- 20% Infrastructure maintenance
- 20% Defense and security
- 10% Emergency reserves
- 10% Administrative costs

### Regional Variations

*"The basics are the same everywhere—it's the details that keep trade interesting."*
- Merchant-Scout Longstride of StarField Camp

While the Confederate Model dominates throughout most of Elyrium, several notable variations exist:

**The Northern Compact**
- Higher tax rates (15%) but includes mutual defense guarantees
- Centralized portal response team
- Joint military training programs

**The Coastal Confederations**
- Focus on harbor maintenance and sea trade
- Lower basic tax (8%) with additional port fees
- Special provisions for seafaring commerce

**The Mountain Alliances**
- Emphasis on mining rights and mineral sharing
- Complex system of tunnel maintenance fees
- Joint underground-surface defense arrangements

*Note: The systems described here represent common practices rather than universal laws. Individual confederations may modify these arrangements based on local needs and traditions. Travelers are advised to consult local authorities regarding specific regulations and tax rates.*

## Calendar and Time

### The Calendar of Elyrium

In a world where reality itself proves uncertain, the peoples of Elyrium have developed a remarkably orderly method of marking time's passage. This system emerged not from any single decree or authority, but from centuries of practical necessity as trade networks grew and communities needed reliable ways to coordinate their efforts.

#### The Span: Rhythm of Trade and Rest

The foundation of Elyrium's calendar is the ten-day span, a cycle that mirrors the valued metals of commerce in its very naming. Each span divides neatly into two halves, with days named in ascending order of metallic worth.

| First Half  | Second Half |
|-------------|-------------|
| Copper Day  | Copper Day  |
| Iron Day    | Iron Day    |
| Silver Day  | Silver Day  |
| Gold Day    | Gold Day    |
| Market Day  | Rest Day    |

This pattern proves remarkably practical. Traders know that any settlement will be ready for commerce on Market Day. Crafters can plan their work across the four-day sequences. Even the nomadic elves, who might view time quite differently in their own culture, find it useful to know that the fifth and tenth days of each span hold special significance in settled communities.

#### Moons and Quarters: The Agricultural Foundation

Three spans make a moon, and three moons make a quarter - a rhythm that follows the natural progression of growing seasons.

| Quarter          | Moons           |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Growing Quarter  | Early Growing   |
|                  | Mid Growing     |
|                  | Late Growing    |
| Harvest Quarter  | Early Harvest   |
|                  | Mid Harvest     |
|                  | Late Harvest    |
| Frost Quarter    | Early Frost     |
|                  | Mid Frost       |
|                  | Late Frost      |
| Thaw Quarter     | Early Thaw      |
|                  | Mid Thaw        |
|                  | Late Thaw       |

Within each quarter, the moons are simply known as Early, Mid, and Late, creating a natural progression that everyone can follow. A farmer needs no special knowledge to understand that "Early Growing" means the beginning of planting season, just as a trader knows that "Late Harvest" suggests urgency in completing their business before winter's approach.

#### The Structure of Time
- 1 span = 10 days
- 1 moon = 3 spans (30 days)
- 1 quarter = 3 moons (90 days)
- 1 year = 4 quarters (360 days)

#### The Long Count: Years of the First Accord

Ask three different scholars about the nature of the First Accord, and you'll likely receive five different answers. Some claim it marked the first successful cooperation between humans and elves in managing portal manifestations. Others insist it commemorates the earliest collaboration between dwarven miners and gnomish crafters. A few suggest it represents something far more mystical - perhaps the original balance struck between Rift and Balance magics.

Whatever its true origin, the current year stands at 1057 of the First Accord, and even those who dispute its meaning find the count useful for trade contracts and historical records. Different communities maintain their own dating systems alongside this common count, but when goods move between settlements or agreements need to be recorded, the Years of the First Accord provide a standard everyone understands.

#### In Practice: Using the Calendar

The full formal way to specify a date - "Second Gold of the Third Span of Mid Growing, Year 1057" - typically appears only in official documents and contracts. In everyday use, context determines how precise one needs to be. A craftsperson might promise delivery "by First Silver next span," while a caravan master could plan to "return in Late Frost."

Each community overlays its own observations and holidays on this framework. Human settlements might hold festivals at quarter-changes, while elven camps could mark astronomical events that hold special significance. Dwarven mines often track shifts and operations using their own precise systems within the span structure, and gnomish settlements are known for maintaining intricate mechanical chronometers that subdivide days with remarkable precision.

This flexibility - rigid enough to coordinate trade across vast distances, yet loose enough to accommodate local customs - perfectly illustrates how the peoples of Elyrium have learned to impose just enough order on their world without stifling its natural rhythms and cultural diversity. In a realm where reality itself can grow thin, the calendar provides a dependable framework through which communities can coordinate their efforts and plan their futures.

### Time Measurement

*"Time flows like a river, but we still need to know when the market opens."*  
- Common gnomish saying

#### The Segment System

In Elyrium, each day is divided into thirty segments, grouped into three spannets: Sunrise, Sunset, and Dark. Each spannet contains ten segments, providing a practical way to measure time's passage that works equally well for precise gnomish chronometers and casual marketplace arrangements.

##### The Three Spannets

| Spannet  | Encompasses                                    | Typical Activities                            |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Sunrise  | From dawn through early afternoon             | Markets open, morning trade, field work       |
| Sunset   | From afternoon through evening                | Crafting hours, caravan departures, closing trade |
| Dark     | Through the night until dawn                  | Night watches, stargazing, secret meetings   |

Most daily business requires only approximate timing. A merchant might announce their market opens at "Second Sunrise," while a tavern keeper calls last drinks at "Sunset Eight." City gates typically close at "Dark Two," giving travelers time to seek lodging after nightfall. More casual arrangements often reference broader periods - "early Sunrise" or "mid-Sunset" - understanding these to mean roughly three segments' time.

##### Cultural Approaches

Each of Elyrium's peoples has developed their own relationship with time's passage. The gnomes, with their love of precision, craft intricate chronometers that track all thirty segments with remarkable accuracy. These devices can be found in every gnomish settlement, and many have been commissioned for human marketplaces and dwarven mines. The gnomes take particular pride in maintaining public time-telling devices, seeing it as both a civic duty and a demonstration of their crafting expertise.

Deep underground, dwarven settlements maintain strict segment tracking out of necessity. The rhythm of mine work demands precision, leading to elaborate systems of bells that echo through the tunnels to mark segment changes. These bell patterns become so ingrained in mining communities that many dwarves can tell time simply by the distant echoes of different shafts' work schedules.

Human settlements take a more practical approach, primarily concerned with coordinating markets and trade. Their day revolves around key segments - market opening, midday trade, and closing - with public activities typically scheduled on round segments for simplicity. In farming communities, the segment system merges with more traditional ways of marking time by sun position and task completion.

The elves, especially during their night watches, have mastered the art of tracking Dark spannet segments by the stars. Their nomadic nature has led them to develop sophisticated methods of confirming segment passage using celestial markers, though they're equally likely to reference time by task completion as by segment count.

#### Time-Telling Devices

The most precise chronometers emerge from gnomish workshops, where master craftsmen employ everything from calibrated water flows to intricate gear systems to track segments. These mechanisms represent the pinnacle of time-telling technology, though simpler devices serve for everyday use. Public squares often feature water clocks or sundials, while Dark spannet timing might be kept by carefully marked candles or hourglasses.

Professional timing tools vary by trade. Craftsmen often use segment glasses calibrated to specific processes, while market squares ring bells to mark significant segments of the trading day. In mines and other workplaces where precision matters, specialized devices help coordinate complex operations requiring careful timing.

#### Formal References

When precision is required, particularly in contracts or official documents, time is noted by spannet and segment number: "Sunrise Three," "Sunset Seven," or "Dark Nine." This system provides enough precision for commerce and crafting while remaining intuitive for everyday use. Whether scheduling a market delivery or timing a complex craft process, the thirty-segment day serves the needs of all Elyrium's peoples.

## Adventuring

### Notable Adventurers of the Sunset Accord

#### Tinwhistle Brightkey
*Gnomish Security Specialist of Brass Gate*

"Locks, traps, and sealed doors? Those are just puzzles waiting to be solved. Portal fluctuations just make it more interesting."

When the master craftsmen of Brass Gate need their workshops secured against both mundane thieves and reality disruptions, they call on Tinwhistle. Like many gnomish security specialists, she learned her craft by first understanding how things break—both physically and reality-wise. Her reputation grew after she successfully retrieved a priceless mechanical chronometer from a portal-warped vault where the interior space had somehow become larger than the exterior.

Today, she splits her time between testing security systems for the settlement's vaults and joining expeditions where her unique combination of mechanical insight and portal-awareness proves invaluable. She's particularly known for her ability to detect where reality has grown thin enough to create unexpected entry points—and how to seal them.

#### Magister Helena Vale
*Human Rift Mage of Wheathold*

"Reality is more of a suggestion than a rule. The trick is knowing when to make different suggestions."

Helena turned to Rift Magic after a portal manifestation nearly destroyed her family's wheat farm. Rather than abandon the land, she apprenticed herself to a traveling mage and learned to harness the very forces that threatened her home. Unlike the theoretical practitioners in larger cities, she developed a practical, hands-on approach to portal manipulation.

She maintains close ties with the WindRunner Camp's elven traders, using their knowledge of portal patterns to refine her understanding of rift dynamics. Her pragmatic approach to Rift Magic has proven particularly effective in crisis situations, where academic precision matters less than quick, effective results.

#### Swiftstride
*Elven Ranger of WindRunner Camp*

"The wilderness is never truly wild—it just follows different rules than we do. Learn those rules, and you'll never be lost."

When the camps need to chart new migration routes through portal-affected territories, they send for Swiftstride. An elf of few words but keen eyes, she has an uncanny ability to read both natural patterns and portal disturbances. She learned her craft over decades of observing how portal manifestations affect local wildlife, developing techniques for predicting safe paths through even the most unstable regions.

Her reputation for reliability has made her a sought-after guide for expeditions needing to traverse the wilderness between settlements. She's particularly valued for her ability to spot the subtle signs that distinguish natural threats from portal-influenced ones.

#### Commander Granite-Arm
*Dwarven Warrior of Iron Root*

"Steel and stone don't lie, even when reality does. Trust your weapon, trust your armor, and trust your training."

The defense of Iron Root's mining operations requires more than just martial skill—it demands an understanding of how to fight effectively when reality itself becomes unreliable. Granite-Arm pioneered many of the techniques now standard among Accord warriors for maintaining combat effectiveness in portal-affected areas.

His fighting school emphasizes solid stance work and adaptable weapon techniques that remain effective regardless of local reality distortions. His methods have proven so successful that even the human settlements now send their guards to train under him.

#### Elder Moonwhisper
*Elven Balance Druid of StarField Camp*

"The land remembers. Listen carefully, and it will tell you what it needs."

Where others see conflict between civilization and nature, Moonwhisper sees opportunities for harmony. She developed her unique approach to Balance Magic while helping StarField Camp maintain stable grazing grounds in portal-affected areas. Her methods don't just preserve natural harmony—they actively help communities thrive within it.

She's become particularly known for her ability to establish "harmony anchors"—places where natural patterns are strong enough to resist portal disruption. Several human settlements now maintain prosperous farms thanks to her techniques.

#### Thorgrim Portalbane
*Dwarven Monster Hunter of Copper Deep*

"Dragons are predictable once you understand they're not trying to be unpredictable—they just see a different reality than we do."

After a portal-warped drake nearly collapsed Copper Deep's main shaft, Thorgrim dedicated himself to understanding how portal exposure affects dangerous creatures. Working closely with gnomish artificers, he developed new techniques for predicting and countering the behavior of reality-touched beasts.

His expertise has proven invaluable not just in protecting the mines, but in helping surface settlements deal with increasingly strange threats from the portal-affected wilderness. He maintains detailed records of how different creatures react to reality distortions, making him a valued consultant for settlements dealing with new threats.

#### Mari Stormweaver
*Human Battle Mage of Rivermill*

"The frontier doesn't care about the difference between magic and steel. Out here, you use whatever works to stay alive."

Mari developed her combat style patrolling the dangerous borderlands between Rivermill and the portal-touched wilderness. While most battle mages train in formal military units, she learned through necessity, combining sword work with battlefield magic to handle everything from portal-warped beasts to reality-bending bandits.

Unlike traditional battle mages who rely heavily on practiced formations and established tactics, Mari specializes in adaptive combat techniques that work even when reality itself becomes unreliable. She's particularly famous for her ability to maintain spell effectiveness even in areas where portal activity makes conventional magic unpredictable. Her methods have become increasingly popular among frontier guards who can't count on reality remaining stable during a fight.

#### Whisperwind
*Elven Shadow Agent of StarField Camp*

"The best way through a wall isn't always breaking it or picking its lock—sometimes it's finding where reality forgot it exists."

Originally trained to protect StarField's valuable horse herds from rustlers, Whisperwind discovered an affinity for using portal distortions to her advantage. She developed techniques for predicting where reality might grow thin enough to create unexpected pathways, combining traditional stealth skills with an intuitive understanding of portal dynamics.

Her methods have proven invaluable not just for protection but for recovery operations in portal-affected areas where conventional approaches would be too dangerous.

#### Master Holdfast
*Dwarven Reality Anchor of Iron Root*

"Chaos is like water—it flows where it wants unless you know how to channel it."

The stable operation of Iron Root's deepest mines depends on Holdfast's ability to maintain zones of reliable reality where portal influence would otherwise make mining impossible. Through decades of experience, he's developed techniques for establishing and maintaining areas of stability even in highly disrupted regions.

His methods have been adapted for use in surface settlements, creating safe zones where sensitive work can be carried out regardless of nearby portal activity. He trains others in his techniques, ensuring that the Accord's communities can maintain stability in crucial areas.

#### Master Gearsong
*Gnomish Artificer of Silver Spire*

"Any fool can build something that works when reality behaves itself. The trick is making it work when reality decides to take a holiday."

The intricate mechanisms produced in Silver Spire's workshops were once notoriously unreliable in portal-affected areas—until Gearsong developed new principles of construction that account for reality fluctuations. Her innovations combine traditional gnomish precision with an understanding of how portal energies affect mechanical systems.

She's particularly known for her "stable-state" devices—tools and mechanisms that continue functioning reliably even when local reality becomes unstable. Her designs have become standard equipment for expeditions into portal-affected areas.

*Note: These individuals represent some of the Sunset Accord's most accomplished adventurers, but they are not the only practitioners of their arts. Each has developed techniques particularly suited to the unique challenges of frontier life in portal-affected regions.*

### Sample Adventure: Trouble on the Silver Road
*A Beginning Adventure for 3-5 Characters*

#### Adventure Background

The trade route between StarField Camp and Silver Spire, traditionally one of the safest in the Sunset Accord, has recently been plagued by unusually effective bandit raids. The bandits strike quickly and disappear with their loot, leaving minimal traces. More concerning still, they seem to know exactly when valuable cargo is moving, suggesting either inside information or supernatural observation.

Unknown to all, these raids are being coordinated by a young dragon named Shiftweave, who has discovered a portal in the wilderness. The dragon uses the portal's reality-bending properties to help the bandits escape and to observe trade movements. Shiftweave fears the portal will be closed if discovered, destroying what it sees as a perfect opportunity to study reality distortions while accumulating wealth.

#### Adventure Hook

The party can become involved in several ways:
- Hired as caravan guards by StarField Camp
- Contracted by Silver Spire to investigate missing shipments
- Asked by local leaders to solve the bandit problem
- Stumbling upon a raid in progress

#### Part 1: The First Raid

**Setup**
- The party encounters or guards a small caravan
- Location: Forested road between settlements
- Time: Early morning or late afternoon

**Bandit Team Alpha**
A moderate challenge for beginning adventurers. The five bandits work as a coordinated unit:
- Two melee fighters with swords and shields, acting as frontline protection
- Two sling-wielding bandits who attack from cover in the trees
- One leader who looks for opportunities to strike distracted opponents

**Tactics**
- Sling-users stay hidden in the trees, making them harder to target
- Melee bandits focus on whoever seems most threatening
- Leader circles the fight looking for advantageous positions
- Group retreats if they lose more than half their numbers
- They fight competently but not to the death

**Aftermath**
- Bandits attempt to flee into the woods
- If captured, they only know they deliver goods to a camp
- Loot is modest: some coins, weapons, leather armor

#### Part 2: The Second Strike

**Setup**
- Occurs 1-2 days after first raid
- Larger caravan or better-looking target
- Same general area

**Bandit Team Beta**
A significant challenge, more dangerous than the first group:
- Three melee fighters, better equipped than the first group
- Two sling specialists with better aim
- One veteran leader who fights more skillfully than the previous leader
- This group coordinates their attacks more effectively

**Tactics**
- More sophisticated strategy than the first group
- Attempt to separate party members
- Leader specifically targets obvious spellcasters
- More likely to surrender if things go badly

**Information Gathering**
If captured, the veteran leader can reveal:
- Location of the bandit camp
- Presence of a "scaled master" who helps them
- Use of a "shimmering doorway" to escape
- About 20 total bandits in the operation

#### Part 3: The Bandit Camp

**Location**
- Hidden valley 2 miles off the main road
- Portal manifests in a natural rock formation
- 15-20 bandits total in camp

**Camp Layout**
```
       Trees
    T  T  T  T
  T [Guard Post] T
    \    |    /
T    [Campsite]
  T   |      |   T
[Storage] [Portal]
    T  T  T  T
```

**Security**
- Two guards at the post
- Several bandits awake in camp at any time
- Portal area usually guarded
- Patrols move between areas

**Stealth Approach**
- Multiple paths for sneaking into camp
- Each area provides different challenges for stealth
- Success reduces forces in final confrontation
- Creative use of distractions can be effective

#### Part 4: The Dragon's Den

**Shiftweave, Young Portal Dragon**
While small for a dragon (6-7 feet at shoulder), Shiftweave is still a formidable opponent:
- Quick and agile
- Natural armor
- Sharp claws and teeth
- Special abilities:
  * Can briefly shift position through reality
  * Resistant to magic near portals
  * Can breathe a cone of reality-warping force

**Tactics**
- Initially hostile, assumes party wants to close portal
- Uses reality shifting to maintain tactical advantage
- Calls for bandit reinforcements if threatened
- Will negotiate if seriously wounded

**Negotiation**
Shiftweave will consider the following:
- Moving operations elsewhere
- Sharing portal knowledge
- Paying reparations
- Future cooperation

**Resolution**
The adventure can end several ways:
1. Dragon slain, bandits scatter
2. Deal struck with dragon
3. Portal closed (dragon leaves)
4. Partial resolution (some bandits remain)

#### Rewards

**Experience**
GMs should award appropriate experience for:
- Surviving bandit encounters
- Successful stealth
- Dealing with the dragon
- Creative problem-solving
- Good roleplaying

**Treasure**
- Bandit loot: Modest coins and equipment
- Camp treasure: Trade goods and silver
- Dragon's hoard: Gold and gems
- Scales or teeth from dragon (if defeated)

**Other Rewards**
- Faction reputation increases
- Possible dragon ally/informant
- Trade route security restored
- Portal location knowledge

#### Appendix: Portal Location

This location can become a continuing resource for the party:
- Portal remains unless specifically closed
- Dragon might return if fled
- Could become party's secret route
- Might attract other portal-related events

*Note for GMs: This adventure can be expanded by adding complications like:*
- Rival adventuring party
- Portal-warped creatures
- Elven trackers seeking revenge
- Local political intrigue
- Reality distortions affecting the surrounding area

## Quick Start Guide

Throughout the lands of Elyrium, reality itself occasionally grows thin. These thinnings manifest as portals - shimmering doorways that appear without warning and disappear after enough people pass through them. Their presence shapes every aspect of life, from the way cities are built to how magic functions.

### The Peoples of the Land

Four peoples shape Elyrium's civilization, existing in complementary pairs that reflect deeper patterns within the world itself. Humans build permanent settlements and farm the land, while their counterparts, the nomadic elves, maintain elaborate tent cities and manage vast trading networks. Similarly, dwarves delve deep into mountains for precious metals and stone, creating grand underground halls, while gnomes apply precision and ingenuity to create intricate mechanisms and fine crafts. These pairs aren't merely cultural - they represent fundamental approaches to life itself.

### Magic and Reality

Magic in Elyrium manifests in two distinct but related forms. Rift Magic draws power from portal disturbances, growing stronger near these reality tears but becoming more unpredictable as a result. Its practitioners - known simply as mages - can achieve spectacular effects, though at the risk of further destabilizing local reality. In contrast, Balance Magic taps into natural harmonies, working best in areas untouched by portal phenomena. Druids who practice this art achieve subtler but more reliable effects, maintaining the delicate equilibrium that prevents chaos from overwhelming the world.

### Threats and Guardians

Among Elyrium's most remarkable creatures are its dragons - not the towering behemoths of legend, but intelligent beings roughly the size of draft horses that are drawn to portal disruptions. They understand reality differently than mortals do, making them both fascinating and dangerous. Standing in opposition to them are the Giant Balance Bears, massive creatures that can rise to fourteen feet when standing. These guardians of natural harmony actively protect areas where the world's patterns flow undisturbed.

### Running Adventures in Elyrium

A typical party might include representatives from several peoples, each bringing their own approach to the challenges of a portal-touched world. A human mage might work alongside an elven scout, while a dwarven warrior protects a gnomish artificer. Adventures often revolve around managing portal manifestations, protecting trade routes, or mediating between the needs of civilization and natural harmony.

When starting your first game, consider beginning in an established confederation like the Sunset Accord. This gives players a stable base from which to explore while introducing them to the interconnected nature of Elyrium's communities. Portal manifestations provide natural hooks for adventure - perhaps a new portal threatens a trade route, or bandits have found a way to use portal phenomena to their advantage.

Remember that while portals are central to Elyrium's identity, they're a tool for storytelling rather than the story itself. The real tales emerge from how people adapt to and influence their portal-touched world, whether they're crafting portal-closing dolls, establishing new trade routes, or finding ways to protect their communities from reality's fluctuations.

Your journey into Elyrium begins here. Welcome to a world where reality itself is negotiable, but the bonds between peoples remain strong.

## Design Principles and Philosophy

In crafting the world of Elyrium, certain fundamental principles shape how reality operates and how stories unfold within its borders. These guidelines help maintain the internal consistency that makes the world feel both fantastic and grounded.

### The Observable and the Unknown

Perhaps the most crucial distinction in Elyrium lies between what can be observed and what must be taken on faith. Portals undeniably exist - their effects can be measured, their influence on local reality documented, their closure achieved through tested methods. The four sapient species display clear physical and social characteristics that anyone can verify. Magic, whether drawing upon portal disturbances or natural harmony, produces effects that can be studied and replicated.

Yet for every certainty in Elyrium, deeper mysteries remain. The true nature of portals - their origin, their purpose, their deeper meaning - spawns endless debate among scholars and mystics alike. Gods may or may not exist; while many believe in divine influences, such matters remain firmly in the realm of faith rather than fact. Even the source of magical power, though its effects can be measured and predicted, raises philosophical questions that have no definitive answer.

### Systems and Societies

Rather than prescribing specific practices, Elyrium establishes frameworks within which communities develop their own solutions. The Confederate Model of governance, for instance, outlines basic principles of cooperation between species while leaving individual implementations to local choice. Similarly, the calendar provides structure for trade and coordination while accommodating diverse cultural interpretations of time's passage.

This approach extends to all aspects of life. While gnomes mint the coins that facilitate trade throughout the known world, each community develops its own economic practices within that framework. Though portal manifestation follows observable patterns, each region develops its own methods for managing these phenomena. Even magic, for all its studied principles, sees wildly different applications across various cultures and communities.

### Natural Tensions

The world of Elyrium contains inherent tensions that drive stories without mandating specific conflicts. Portal disruption naturally opposes natural harmony, yet both forces prove necessary for the world's functioning. The dynamic innovation of humans complements the perfecting persistence of elves, while dwarven grand works find their counterpoint in gnomish precision. These tensions create opportunities for both conflict and cooperation without prescribing which should prevail.

Similarly, the opposition between Rift and Balance Magic reflects not a struggle between good and evil, but rather two valid approaches to understanding and influencing reality. Even the great beasts of the realm - dragons drawn to portal manifestations and Balance Bears protecting natural harmony - represent competing but necessary forces rather than absolute opponents.

### Expanding the World

When adding to Elyrium, maintain this balance between the known and the mysterious. New settlements might establish their own traditions, but these should grow from established foundations rather than overturning them. Local religions might interpret the nature of portals differently, but none should be able to definitively prove their interpretation correct. Even new applications of magic should work within the established frameworks of Rift and Balance rather than introducing entirely new forces.

The key lies in understanding that Elyrium's strength comes not from providing every answer, but from creating a space where many answers might be true. Like the portals themselves, the world remains partially undefined - solid enough to build upon, yet flexible enough to accommodate the unexpected.
