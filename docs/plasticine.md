## Introduction

The Plasticine system is inspired by OpenD6 and HERO.

Plasticine is presented in three parts:

- **Character creation** covers the process of creating a character. This is important for both GM and Player, since it is done either before the first session or during it.

- **Campaign world** covers how to build a campaign. Plasticine is a generic system, so settings from other role playing games can be adapted. This section is mostly for the GM. The campaign world section covers how to give players guidance for creating their characters.

- **Game play:** This covers how the game is played. As with most role-playing games, the mechanics end up mattering the most for "action sequences". This includes, but is not limited to, combat. For example, rescuing people from the path of a volcano does not involve combat, but does use the same mechanics.

## Core Mechanic

Plasticine uses one core mechanic.
How "good" something is is measured in pips.
Pips define how to roll for things:

* Divide pips in three, with remainder.
* The result is the number of dice.
* The remainder is the bonus.

For example, if something is bought to 10 pips:

* 10/3 = 3 remainder 1
* Roll 3d6+1

High rolls are always better.
Some rolls are pass/fail:
in that case,
the difficulty is represented as a threshold.
For something with 10 pips,
a difficulty of 15 is significant,
but achievable:
you need to roll 3d6+1 and get 15 or more.

Some rolls are vs. rolls:
higher rolls wins.
Something with 10 pips against something with 8 pips
means

* One side: roll 3d6+1
* Other side: roll 2d6+2
* The first side has better chances of winning.

Some rolls are "effect" rolls:
in those cases,
the roll's value translates
directly to the effect.

## Character Creation

In general, players will play one player character (PC) each. The GM might have to create any amount of non-player characters (NPCs) to serve as antagonists or allies for the player characters.

The GM should give the players clear guidance on how to build their characters. See more details in the "Campaign world" section. This includes what kind of backgrounds would be appropriate, as well as any suggested, disallowed, or required choices to make when creating the character's concept using game mechanics.

In Plasticine, creating a character does not involve any random elements. This allows creating a character "offline" without the need to verify rolls.

The sections are ordered in a way that is often useful to define a character:

- **Background:** Who is the character? What do they do? Where do they come from. This is a mini-biography for the character. If you are stuck, search for "character questionnaire for writers". There are several sites which will help with prompts.

- **Problems:** Based on the background, what problems does the character struggle with? This is often more important than the character's abilities.

- **Limitations:** Limitations are modifiers. They cannot be used on their own. They are in a separate section because limitations can limit attributes, skills, or powers. They are essential in adapting concepts to Plasticine.

- **Attributes:** If you are used to other role-playing system, you will notice that Plasticine is missing some of the standards, like Strength or Intelligence. There are three attributes which dictate combat dynamics (how often the character can act, how likely are they to get a hit, and how likely are they to avoid a hit). The last attribute is the character's ability to notice things.

- **Skills:** There are three kinds of skills: background, unopposed, and opposed. Background skills are those which are not likely to have an in-game mechanics effect. This is not a hard and fast rule: a character might use a skill like "Profession: Lawyer" to take advantage of their knowledge of the courtroom to find the best place to duck for cover, giving them a better chance to avoid being hit in a fight that breaks out in the courtroom. Unopposed skills allow the character to accomplish a goal without active resistance. Opposed skills are ones where the character is competing against another character to accomplish a goal. For example, the character trying to defuse a bomb is competing against whoever made the bomb.

- **Powers:** Powers represent the things which are most often done in action sequences. They include attacking, disabling, moving one's self, or moving other things. They can be bought in ways which make them more valuable, and expensive. Related powers can also be bought in systems which make them more affordable.

- **Helper:** A Helper is an NPC, Vehicle, or Base that the character can call on at will. In many campaigns, most or all characters will not have any helpers.

### Character Points

Character points (CP) are used to buy anything that helps a character. Characters use CP to buy:

- Attributes
- Skills
- Powers
- Helpers

Characters get CP from:

- An initial amount (the GM will determine how many)
- Problems (the GM determines minimum/maximum amounts)
- Adventuring

On the character sheet, denote "Total CP" and "Unspent CP" separately.

Everything is bought in pips.
For simplicity,
on the character sheet,
we pre-calculate it in dice.
This makes it faster to run action scenes
during game play.

For example, if something costs 1 pip/1 CP, this means that:

- 1 CP: 1
- 2 CP: 2
- 3 CP: 1d6
- 4 CP: 1d6+1
- 5 CP: 1d6+2
- 6 CP: 2d6

### Background

The character's background is important and should be decided first. The character's background does not need to be paid for in points. Characters can be rich, poor, have a license to drive a tow-truck, or anything else that the player wants.

Note that some of these things, if they have in-game effects, will cost points.

Examples:

- Kevin is so rich he has a huge mansion. This mansion is where Kevin and the team will hide out in, plan their mission, and retreat to. The mansion is bought as a Helper (base).

- Sue is so poor that she can't afford clothes that aren't tatters. Since people react negatively to this, this is a Problem (social).

- PJ has a license to drive a truck. This comes in handy in missions, so they buy it as a Helper (vehicle).

The background should be compatible with the campaign. It should inform the rest of the decisions, although it does not dictate them. Two characters who are martial artists might end up buying different powers as their martial arts.

### Problems

Characters can have problems. In any given campaign, the GM will have guideline for how many problems characters should have. This might be a specific number or a range. Problems are measured in character points. Problems give characters extra character points.

Problems are worth a base of 5 points.

By default, Problems are expected to cause a complication for a character every 3rd session. If a problem complicates a character's life every other session or more often, it is **common** and is worth 5 more CP.

By default, problems are **mild**. When they apply, they are relatively easy to deal with. Problems can be **severe**, which means that when they apply, the effect is significant. In those cases, the problem is worth 5 more CP.

#### Internal

Internal problems are things the characters can't, or won't, do. Physical disabilities as well as Psychological issues are two examples of internal problems.

#### Social

Social problems are the way the character relates to society. This can be someone who depends on the character, someone who is after the character, or something that causes people to discriminate against the character.

#### Mechanics

Mechanics problems affect a character's statistics or combat effectiveness. For example, taking damage from water exposure or getting a minus to all rolls during twilight.

The problem should count as severe if it would take more than 20 CP in an attack power to cause a similar effect.

### Attributes

Most attributes cost 1 pip/CP. Action costs 3 CP/pip.

The following attributes exist:

- Action (ACT) - 3 CP/pip
- Accuracy (ACC) - 1 pip/CP
- Defense (DEF) - 1 pip/CP
- Perception (PER) - 1 pip/CP

It is recommended to buy each to at least 3d6.

#### Action

Action effects **how often** a character acts. In most rounds, a character can only act if they win a ACT roll.

#### Accuracy/Defense

Accuracy and Defense are resolved as skill vs. skill. The higher a character's accuracy is, the higher the chances that it can hit whatever it is aiming at. The higher a character's defense is, the lower the chances that it will get hit.

#### Perception

Perception is the character's ability to notice things. The higher it is, the harder it is to hide things, or people, from the character.

### Skills

Skills are also bought with CP. The kind of skill determines the cost. Background skills are 3 pips/1 CP. Other skills cost 1 pip/1 CP.

All skills can be more or less specific. For example, someone can take "Background: Science: Physics" or "Background: Science: Quantum physics" or even "Background: Science: Quantum electro-dynamics". When trying to solve a problem, compatible specificity levels help, and incompatible levels hurt. This balances specific and generic skills.

#### Specificity

Skills can be more or less specific.
Specificity can give bonuses or penalties.
Before you compute the bonus or penalty,
define the "natural specificity".
Natural specificity is determined by the task itself, not the character's skill


* For every step "up" from the natural specificity, there's a -1 penalty
* For every step "down" from the natural specificity, there's
  * +1 for compatible specificity
  * -1 for incompatible specificity
 
Example: A character buys: "Systems: Modern Linux computers" to 3d6.
They encounter a modern windows computer.
The GM decides the natural specificity is "computer".
Because of that:

* Modern (+1)
* Windows/Linux incompatibility (-1)

Net bonus/penalty: 0

If the character bought: "Systems: Electronics"
that's one step up in specificity,
so the character would be at -1 penalty.

Example: Character has: "Background: Science: Physics" at 3d6

Explaining quantum mechanics:
- Natural specificity: "Science"
- Matching specificity: "Science: Physics"
- Modifier: +1

Identifying a chemical compound:
- Natural specificity: "Chemistry"
- Chemistry is incompatible with Physics
- Modifier: -1

Calculating orbital trajectories
- Natural specificity: "Physics"
- Modifier: +0

Answering general science trivia
- Natural specificity: "Science"
- One step up from "Science: Physics"
- Modifier: -1


#### Background Skills

Background skills are those that pertain to a job or a hobby. For example, "Profession: Lawyer" or "Knowledge: Medieval history". Background skills will often be related to a job, a discipline, or a science.

Background skills, in general, should not have direct effects on game mechanics. If they do, they might need to be bought as a different skill or even a power.

#### Unopposed Skills

These skills help characters accomplish tasks that are not opposed by anyone.

##### Systems Operation

Using a system is done through this skill.
This applies to systems "found in the field". Any system that is in regular use should be bought as a helper or power.

##### Communication

This skill applies to language, oratory, persuasion, and the like. Specificity includes both the task to accomplish and the method of communication. The base difficulty might change based on the communication method and other constraints (for example, noise or needing to be quiet).

Note that communicating in a common language with someone else who knows the language under ideal conditions (no noise, normal distance) is "very easy". In other words, purchasing a language is 1 CP.

#### Opposed Skills

Some skills inherently involve a competition. A security device is only worth as much as it makes it hard for someone else to accomplish their goal. Evading someone is only as useful as it makes it harder to track you.

Opposed skills always come in pairs.

##### Security/Hacking

Build and defeat security systems. This can be as specific or as generic as characters want. One specificity level that characters can, but do not have to, take is offensive/defensive. Defensive skills suffer the "incompatible specificity" for using them to defeat security, offensive skills suffer the "incompatible specificity" for using them to build a security mechanism.

For example, if the character making a lock has "medieval locks" and the character defeating it has "general", then these are two levels of specificity. If the character had "modern locks", this would still be two levels: one up to "locks", one down to "medieval".

Every step of "rushing it" (compared to how long it should ordinarily take to do it) is a +1 to defeat it. Every two steps of "taking extra time" is a -1 to defeat it. Relevant materials and tools can also result in bonuses or penalties.

##### Seeking/Evasion

Seeking is the ability to figure out how to get to where you are going. It includes tracking, navigation, and more. When tracking a character, this is a role against their evasion skill.
Evasion covers any attempt to throw off someone.

### Powers

Powers are the main way characters accomplish in-game effect on mechanics. They can be used to represent technology, experience, superpowers, or magic. Equipment used day-to-day should be bought as powers.

As far as powers are concerned, Body costs 1 pt/1 CP. This means that it is drained, improved, or resisted at though it cost 1 pt/1 CP. Similarly, ACT costs 3 CP/pip for adjustment purposes, reflecting its higher value.

The list of powers is:

- Adjust
- Resist adjustment
- Move
- Push
- Detect
- Signal

Buy powers with the relevant advantages, systems, downsides, and, last but not least, special effects to fit the character and the campaign. The cost of a power, before adjusting for limitations, is its "raw strength".

#### Reduce Statistic

**Reduce statistic: 1 pip/5 CP**

Reduce a statistic by
the effect's size
worth of CP.

The adjustment heals at 1 pip/hour. In most cases, this does not need to be tracked: characters will get to the "next session" in prime condition, but (unless one session represent more than an hour of game time) will not have to consider any healing done during the session.

##### Modifiers

- **Improve (double cost):** Increase attribute instead.
- **Ranged:**
  - 30m: double cost
  - more than 30m: multiple cost by 2.5
  - Ignore obstacles: double cost.
- **AoE:** Multiply cost by 1+log_2(1 + radius)
  - Selective AoE: Double that cost.
- **Decreased healing:** Heals more slowly, 1 + log_2(slowness factor)
- **Use different resistance:** double cost
  - This means adjusting a statistic, but using another statistic's resistance.
  - Each "difference" will cause another doubling: Body and attributes are all considered the same. However, using resistance to Movement power adjustment to target Body adjustment is another doubling. Using "resistance to resistance to Movement power adjustment" to target Body adjustment results in two doublings (for a total of 8x the original cost).
- **Constant:** double cost (after activating, keeps adjusting until turned off)


#### Resist Adjustment in Statistic

**Reduce adjustment: 1 CP/5 CP**

This is bought per attribute, power, skill, or Body separately. Note that as a power, resistance itself can be targetted, and resistance for resistance can be bought. Except for rare cases, this is usually not a good idea.

#### Move

**5m/1 CP**

##### Modifiers

- **Ignore intervening:** double cost


#### Push

Move something 1m.

**1 Weight class/1 CP**

##### Modifier

- **Ranged:** Multiply cost by 1+log_2(range in meters)

Weight class 1 is the weight of an average human. It increases by 1 for each doubling. The name is "push", but it is also used for carrying.

#### Detect

**Base cost: 1 pip per sensitivity level**

Detect allows a character to sense things beyond normal human perception or to enhance existing senses. Each level represents either range, detail level, or sensitivity of detection.

##### Modifiers

- **Range:** Multiply cost by 1+log₂(range in meters)
- **Penetrating:** Double cost to detect through barriers or obstacles
- **Analyze:** Double cost to automatically understand/analyze what is detected
- **Constant:** Double cost to maintain detection without requiring active focus
- **AoE:** Multiply cost by 1+log₂(radius in meters) to detect in an area

#### Signal

**Base cost: 1 CP per intensity level**
- 3 pips become a D, as with other powers

Signal creates sensory output that can be detected by appropriate senses. Unlike Adjust PER powers, Signal powers cannot be used as attacks and do not reduce a target's PER attribute. They represent consensual communication or non-harmful sensory projection.

##### Modifiers

- **Range:** Multiply cost by distance factor
- **Multiple recipients:** Multiply cost by 1+log₂(number of targets)
- **Penetrating:** Double cost to signal through barriers
- **Complex signals:** Double cost for detailed information transfer
- **Constant:** Double cost to maintain signal without requiring active focus

#### Systems

All powers can be bought with the following "systems":

- **Flexible advantage:** Can use any combination of advantages, up to half cost.
- **Variant:** Pay 10% of the power cost, rounded down with a minimum of 1 CP, for another variant of the same power, as long as total cost is the same as lower.

They can be combined, so that the advantage is flexible but the limitations can be changed between a few options.

This means that for the active powers (move and non-constant adjust) there is no reason to buy more than one: buy the most expensive one, and the rest as variants.

### Limitations

Limitations most often apply to powers. They can also be used to apply to attributes or skills.

Cost is divided by 1+total value of disadvantages.

- 0.25 for "barely limiting"
- 0.5 for "severely limiting"
- 1 for "extremely limiting"

Limitations can include:

- Require roll
- Limited uses
- Only functions in specific circumstances
- Requires item
- Increased healing
- Extra time
- Concentration
- Verbalizing
- Gestures

#### Examples

Great framework. Let me work through examples using "how much does this actually reduce usefulness in typical action sequences?"

##### 0.25 Limitation (25% less useful)

**Requires common item**
- "Requires gun" when you're a gunfighter who always carries one
- Maybe 1 in 8 fights you're caught without it (disarmed, ambushed while unarmed)
- 12.5% complete prevention ≈ 25% reduction in value

**Gestures**
- Need hands free to use power
- Rarely bound/grappled in typical fights
- When it matters, costs actions to free hands or position (≈ 25% efficiency loss)

**Verbal component**
- Need to speak/chant
- Occasionally gagged, underwater, or need stealth
- ≈ 15% of situations where you can't use it or it creates complications

**Only against common target type**
- "Only against living creatures" when 90% of your enemies are people
- The 10% where you face constructs/undead, power is useless
- But that's only slightly limiting since it's rare

**Extra time (minor)**
- "Requires 1 extra action to aim/prepare"
- In 5-action fights, this reduces your effective uses from 5 to 3 (40% reduction)
- But many fights last longer, averaging closer to 25% reduction

##### 0.5 Limitation (33% less useful)

**Requires specific item**
- "Requires THIS sword" (not any sword)
- If lost/stolen, major problem until recovered
- Happens maybe once every 3-4 sessions (≈ 25-33% downtime)

**Requires skill roll**
- Add uncertainty to every use
- With reasonable skill, ≈ 20-30% failure rate
- Plus the psychological cost of unreliability

**Only on ground/flat surface**
- Fighting in trees, on slopes, while flying = can't use
- Maybe 25-30% of encounters have problematic terrain

**Limited uses (moderate)**
- "3 uses per session" when you'd ideally use it 4-5 times
- Forces conservation, sometimes can't use when optimal
- Effective 30-40% reduction in utility

**Extra time (significant)**
- "Requires 2 actions to prepare/activate"
- In typical 6-action fight, reduces uses from 6 to 2 (67% reduction)
- But can sometimes prepare before combat, averaging to ≈ 35% reduction

**Only against moderately common type**
- "Only against living creatures" when you face undead/constructs 25-30% of time
- Clear 25-30% complete prevention

##### 1.0 Limitation (50% less useful)

**Only in uncommon circumstance**
- "Only in darkness" when half your fights are in daylight
- "Only underwater" in a campaign with occasional water missions
- Direct 50% prevention rate

**Cool down (exhausts for 3 actions)**
- In 6-action fight: use once, wait 3, use again = 2 uses instead of 6
- 67% reduction in rapid combats, averages to ≈ 50% across campaign

**Only against narrow target type**
- "Only against demons" in a campaign where demons are 40-50% of enemies
- Half the time it's completely useless

**Requires rare/targeted item**
- "Requires artifact that enemies know to target and steal"
- Frequently lost, stolen, or unavailable
- ≈ 50% uptime across campaign

**Limited uses (severe)**
- "Once per session" when you'd want it 2-3 times per session
- Forces you to save it, often can't use optimally
- Effective 50% reduction in value

#####  Calibration Examples

Let's apply this to **Reduce Body 3d6 (Ranged 10m)** - raw cost before limitations:

**Unrestricted**: 45 CP base × 4 range multiplier = 180 CP

**With 0.25 limitation** (one of):

- Requires gun (carried daily, rarely lost): 180/1.25 = **144 CP**
- Verbal component (occasional issue): 180/1.25 = **144 CP**

**With 0.5 limitation** (one of):

- Requires specific weapon: 180/1.5 = **120 CP**
- Requires skill roll: 180/1.5 = **120 CP**
- Only against living targets (when you sometimes fight robots): 180/1.5 = **120 CP**

**With 1.0 limitation** (one of):

- Only in darkness (half of fights): 180/2 = **90 CP**
- Cool down 3 actions: 180/2 = **90 CP**
- Once per session: 180/2 = **90 CP**

**Multiple limitations stack**: 
- Requires specific weapon (0.5) + Verbal (0.25) + Limited ammo (0.25) = 180/2.0 = **90 CP**

##### The Agnostic Test

For a power, you should be roughly indifferent between:

**Attack Option A**: Reduce Body 3d6, ranged, unrestricted (180 CP)
**Attack Option B**: Reduce Body 4d6, ranged, requires weapon (60×4/1.25 = 192 CP)
**Attack Option C**: Reduce Body 5d6, ranged, requires specific weapon (75×4/1.5 = 200 CP)
**Attack Option D**: Reduce Body 6d6, ranged, only in darkness (90×4/2 = 180 CP)

These are all similar costs, but Option D has 2× the dice when it works but only works half the time. Option A always works but with fewer dice. The question "which is better" should depend on your character concept and campaign, not obvious optimization.

### Helper

A helper can be an NPC, a vehicle, or a base. Calculate their cost as though they were a character, and divide by 5 (rounding down, minimum 1). You can double the amounts of helpers by paying the cost again: two identical NPCs would double the cost, but eight identical NPCs would only quadruple the cost. A helper cannot cost more than the character.

### Examples

Because this way of building game effects is abstract, it can be non-trivial to understand how to use it to build powers. In general, Plasticine's goal for balance is that powers with similar effect on action sequence mechanics will have similar costs.

Important to remember: it is not how complicated it would be to achieve the special effect in real life, it is how beneficial the effect is in action sequences. For example, although most well-trained hand-to-hand combatants will know how to block a punch while unaided human flight is still a technological dream, blocking is more expensive than flight.

#### Invisibility

This is a standard power in literature, from Greek invisibility cloaks to the Invisible woman. In game terms, it is designed to make it harder to perceive the character. Perceiving someone in front of you is normally a Very Easy task, so PER needs to be reduced to 0.

Most characters bought 9 CP worth of PER (for 3d6). A 3d6 reduction of PER is usually enough for that.

- Reduce PER, 3d6, Area of Effect: 4m: 15 * (1+1): Raw strength 30.
- Limitations: Only against sight (1), Only to avoid perceiving the character (1): (1+1+1)=3
- Cost: 10 CP

#### Block

A maneuver designed to get inside the attacker's range by blocking a strike, so it is possible to counter-attack. This is simulated by buying 2d6 of Defense, and having an increased ACT if the attack misses.

- 2d6 Defense (6)
  - Limitations: Requires using action (1), Only against Hand-to-Hand (0.5)
- 3d6 Increase ACT (30)
  - Limitations: Self-only (0.5), Only if an attack missed (1)
- Total: 16

It ends up being somewhat expensive, but useful maneuver. It could be made less expensive by requiring a skill roll, or reducing the amount of ACT increase. Note that a different character, who interprets the desired mechanic of block differently, might buy a different power with the same special effect.

#### Flight

From Icarus to Superman, flight is a common power in literature. The "move" power is already 3-dimensional by default. In order to simulate the inertia from flight, some limitations are appropriate. A single unit of turning on a hex grid is 60 degrees. It is 45 degrees on a square grid.

- Move: 30m
  - Raw strength: 6 CP
- Limitations: Speed inertia: can increase/reduce speed 5m/round (0.5), Direction inertia: can do one turn unit per round (0.5)
- Total cost: 6/(1+0.5+0.5) = 3

#### Generic Martial Arts

The character has trained in a martial art. It might be Kung Fu, Karate, or Tai Kwan Do: those are the special effects.

- 3d6 Reduce Body (45)
- 4d6 System (12)
  - 1 Accuracy
  - 1 Defense
  - 1 Act
- Total raw strength: 60
- Limitation: Requires skill roll (0.5 Limitation)
- Cost: 60/1.5=40

The character can use the martial art to strike someone with punches, kicks, elbows, or any other way that makes sense thematically. It can use the accuracy, defense, or act bonuses up to a maximum of 4d6, apportioning them as they want. A defensive strike might be 4d6 Defense, with no bonus to accuracy. A "fast punch" might be 2d6 Act, 2d6 Accuracy.

It might be useful, but not required, for the players to think of "interesting combinations" and name them, together with a special effect. This can help make combat play faster.

If a character wants to simulate "holds", these will be "Reduce Move" attacks.

#### Underwater Breathing

A character that cannot breath underwater will suffer Body damage and eventually pass out. This means that to breath underwater is to resist that damage.

- Resistance: Body, 1CP (5 Raw strength)
- Limitation: Only against damage from breathing water (2)
- Total cost: 5/(1+2) = 2

#### Immortality

Since this power does not have an in-game mechanic effect, it is free. This is another example of how powers cost commensurate to the effect they have on game mechanics, not on how desirable they would be to a character.

#### Telepathy

- Detect: Thoughts, 2d6 (6 CP raw strength)
  - Limitations: Requires concentration (0.5), Line of sight only (0.5)
  - Cost: 6/(1+0.5+0.5) = 3 CP
- Signal: Mental communication, 2d6 (6 CP raw strength)
  - Limitations: Requires concentration (0.5), Line of sight only (0.5)
  - Cost: 6/(1+0.5+0.5) = 3 CP
- Total: 6 CP

This represents two-way mental communication. The Detect component allows reading surface thoughts, while the Signal component allows sending thoughts to willing recipients. Both require concentration and line of sight.

#### Enhanced Vision (Night Vision)

- Detect: Visual information, 3d6 (9 CP raw strength)
  - Limitations: Only in low light conditions (1), Only visual spectrum (0.5)
  - Cost: 9/(1+1+0.5) = 3.6 CP (rounded to 4 CP)

This allows the character to see clearly in darkness or low-light conditions. The limitation reflects that it only works when there's insufficient light for normal vision.

#### Radio Transceiver

- Detect: Radio signals, 3d6 (9 CP raw strength)
  - Range: 1 km (x11 multiplier): 99 CP raw strength
  - Limitations: Only radio frequency (1), Requires equipment (0.5)
  - Cost: 99/(1+1+0.5) = 39.6 CP (rounded to 40 CP)
- Signal: Radio transmission, 3d6 (9 CP raw strength)
  - Range: 1 km (x11 multiplier): 99 CP raw strength
  - Limitations: Only radio frequency (1), Requires equipment (0.5)
  - Cost: 99/(1+1+0.5) = 39.6 CP (rounded to 40 CP)
- Total: 80 CP

This represents a character with a radio communication device. Both receiving and transmitting capabilities are needed for two-way communication.

#### Danger Sense

- Detect: Imminent danger, 3d6 (9 CP raw strength)
  - Limitations: Only detects physical threats (0.5), Only works within 10m (0.5)
  - Cost: 9/(1+0.5+0.5) = 4.5 CP (rounded to 5 CP)

This gives the character an intuitive warning when physical danger is near, potentially allowing them to avoid ambushes or detect hidden threats. The GM may provide automatic PER checks when this power activates.

#### Empathic Reading

- Detect: Emotions, 2d6 (6 CP raw strength)
  - Limitations: Surface emotions only (0.5), Requires eye contact (0.5)
  - Cost: 6/(1+0.5+0.5) = 3 CP

This allows the character to sense the emotional state of people they can see. It might provide bonuses on certain Communication skill checks when the character can use their insight into the target's emotional state.


## Campaign World

Plasticine is a generic system. Each usage might be different. When planning the campaign world, most work should go to the color: who lives there? What are their relationships?

This can be our world, an alternate universe, or a completely different world. It is important to have a clear idea of where characters will adventure.

As a generic system, you should be able to adapt source books from other games to Plasticine.

### Character Guidance

The last thing to do is to give the players clear guidance on what characters they should build. This might constrain the background ("all characters must be adult humans living in a specific city"). It will almost always constrain the character creation mechanics:

- What powers, attributes, skills, or problems are considered the "free baseline"?
- Base CP
- Minimum/maximum CP from problems
- What is the maximum for attributes?
- What is the maximum raw strength for a power?
- What is the maximum level for skills? Is it different for background skills?
- What power systems, limitations, or advantages, are allowed?

Rough guidance:

- 25 CP is "normal human"
- 50 CP is "protagonist in a 'realistic' action movie or TV show"
- 100 CP is "superhero"
- 200 CP is "cosmic scale superhero"

A good rule of thumb is to let 20% to 30% of the points to come from problems. For example, in a superhero campaign, allow characters to have 25 CP of problems.

### Advancement

In general,
characters should get
1-5CP per successful session.
This feels meaningful but not world-changing
in most genres
("realistic" to "cosmic").

### Baseline

For most campaigns, the GM will want to design a "package" of problems, attributes, skills, and powers that characters get without using or expending character points.

In general, base packages should be around 30 CP - 50 CP. This means that for a "normal human", most of their effectiveness comes from the base package! This is as it should be: this is what makes people normal, after all.

For example, the following might be an appropriate base package for every day humans:

**Attributes:**

- 2d6 DEX
- 2d6 Accuracy
- 2d6 Defense
- 2d6 Offense

**Powers:**

- Hand to hand attack: Reduce Body by 1
- Running: Move 1m, only on ground

**Skills:**

- 3d6 Background: Professional
- +1 Native language

### Campaign Examples

It is a good idea for the GM to write example character sheets as part of campaign planning. These can serve as inspiration to existing characters. They can also serve as off-the-rack characters for players who are new to the game or prefer to use a pre-approved character.

## Game Play

For
day-to-day
actions,
you don't need a roll.
Characters can open a door,
buy a snack,
or talk to a friend.
Plasticine comes into play
for
tasks that are difficult
and plot relevant.

### Location

In general, game play might require to know where each character is. In that case, use either a Hexagonal Grid or a Square one. It is assumed characters can reach, without needing any range, any character in an adjacent.

Each square or hexagon is one meter. For example, a character who can move 1m can move to an adjacent square.

### Body

Body is 30. It cannot be bought higher, but for the sake of adjustment powers, it is considered 1 Body/1 CP.

On Body 0, characters lose consciousness. Death is story-driven, not rule-driven: important characters won't die, less important characters might or might not die based on setting and story.

### Dice Rolling

When rolling dice, say 3d6+2, the characters will roll however many dice it says (in this case, three), and add the bonus (in this case, two). For example, if the dice come up 2, 5, and 1, the result is 2+5+1+2=10. Situational bonuses or penalties might apply, as well as specificity bonuses or penalties. Those are added to the result.

In the case of unopposed tasks, use the following guidelines:

- Very easy: 1-5
- Easy: 6-10
- Moderate: 11-15
- Difficult: 16-20
- Very difficult: 21-30
- Heroic: 31+

The GM should determine the level that needs to be reached to be successful based on the task.

In the case of opposed rolls, each character rolls separately. Whoever gets the most wins. Situational or specificity bonuses and penalties are applied before comparing the results.

There are two optional variants for rolling dice. GMs can choose to use neither, both, or either.

#### Fate System

One fate point allows doubling the pips for a single action. Characters get Fate points from adventuring. Fate points, once expended, are expended forever.

#### Wild Die System

One of the dice is pre-designated as a wild die. As long as the wild die comes up six, it is rerolled. The total sum is added. If it comes up 1, the next roll is subtracted from the total and the 1 is discarded. If the next roll comes up 1, the entire roll is a "0".

### Rounds

A "round" is 1 second. Characters can only act in a round if they succeed in rolling ACT vs. Moderate (13).
They act in the order of the ACT roll.

A character can "hold" an action in a round for a future round. Each time the character's roll fails, it gains a +1 bonus to the next roll. This means that even a 2d6 ACT character will eventually act, although often not before being sidelined for a few seconds.

A character can either move or use an adjustment power in a round. For inertia-based movement, "moving" is changing the speed or direction. Often, we refer to adjusting as "attacking". This is the most common use of the power, and is shorter. However, the game mechanics applying to all adjustment powers are identical.

When attacking, characters roll Accuracy vs. Defense. Characters can buy extra defense with "only when doing nothing else" to actively dodge. A character that cannot perceive another gets -6 to their role. Characters can choose to not avoid attacks. In those cases, the Defense is 0.

#### Flanking

If a character moves and then attacks before the opponent can act, the opponent is assumed to be facing the same direction. This means that if a character moves behind an opponent (moving 1m around them) and attacks, they are attacking from behind and gain a +1d6 bonus to Accuracy for that attack. This bonus represents the tactical advantage of an unexpected attack angle.

### Using Skills

Most skills are
"out of action sequences"
and can be considered free actions.
Resolution for skills has been described in the character section.

If more than one skill applies, the character gets to apply all, or any subset, with the relevant modifiers, and sum them.

## Fantasy Adaptation

This section provides adaptations of the Plasticine system for fantasy campaigns. It includes combat abilities, spellcasting, and species considerations to help GMs and players create fantasy characters and adventures.

### Weapon Proficiencies

#### Sword Proficiency

##### Basic Sword Proficiency

- **Reduce Body:** 3d6 (45 CP raw strength)
  - **Limitation:** Requires weapon (sword) (0.5)

### Magic Spells

#### General Magic Rules

Magic in fantasy Plasticine uses the core power system with specific limitations to capture the feel of traditional fantasy spellcasting. The "Cool Down" limitation is particularly important for balancing magical abilities:

- **Cool Down (1.0):** Exhausts magic of this type for the next three actions, preventing further spellcasting.

#### Offensive Magic

##### Area Effect Fire Blast

- **Reduce Body:** 2d6 (30 CP raw strength)
  - **Advantages:**
    - Ranged (10m range: ×4 multiplier) = 120 CP
    - Area of Effect (3m radius: ×2 multiplier) = 240 CP
  - **Limitations:**
    - Requires gestures (0.5)
    - Requires verbalization/incantation (0.5)
    - Requires concentration (0.5)
    - Requires skill roll (0.5)
    - Cool down: exhausts magic for next three actions (1.0)
  - **Cost:** 240/(1+0.5+0.5+0.5+0.5+1.0) = 240/4 = 60 CP

Using the Variant system advantage, a mage could purchase additional related spells at reduced cost:

1. Single-target fire blast (higher damage)
2. Fire shield (defensive application)
3. Fire wall (barrier creation)
4. Heat object (utility application)

#### Healing Magic

##### Combat Healing Touch

- **Improve Body:** 2d6 (30 CP raw strength)
  - Note: Using the "Improve" modifier doubles the base cost
  - **Advantages:** None (touch range is the default)
  - **Limitations:**
    - Requires gestures (0.5)
    - Requires verbalization/incantation (0.5)
    - Requires concentration (0.5)
    - Requires skill roll (0.5)
    - Cool down: exhausts healing magic for next three actions (1.0)
  - **Cost:** 30/(1+0.5+0.5+0.5+0.5+1.0) = 30/4 = 7.5 CP (round to 8 CP)

#### Utility Magic

##### Detect Magic

- **Detect:** Magical energy/auras, 3d6 (9 CP raw strength)
  - **Advantages:**
    - Range: 10m (×4 multiplier) = 36 CP
    - Analyze: To understand the type/purpose of magic (×2 multiplier) = 72 CP
  - **Limitations:**
    - Requires concentration (0.5)
    - Requires gestures (0.5)
    - Duration limited (only active for one action) (0.5)
  - **Cost:** 72/(1+0.5+0.5+0.5) = 72/2.5 = 28.8 CP (round to 29 CP)

##### Basic Detect Magic

- **Detect:** Magical energy/auras, 2d6 (6 CP raw strength)
  - **Advantages:**
    - Range: 5m (×3 multiplier) = 18 CP
  - **Limitations:**
    - Requires concentration (0.5)
    - Requires gestures (0.5)
    - Only detects presence/absence of magic, not details (0.5)
  - **Cost:** 18/(1+0.5+0.5+0.5) = 18/2.5 = 7.2 CP (round to 7 CP)

#### Support Magic

##### Inspire (Leadership Aura)

- **Improve Accuracy and Defense:** 2d6 each (60 CP raw strength)
  - **Advantages:**
    - Area of Effect: 3m radius (×2 multiplier) = 120 CP
  - **Limitations:**
    - Requires verbalization (speech, singing, etc.) (0.5)
    - Requires continuous performance/leadership (concentration) (0.5)
    - Cannot affect self (0.5) - optional
    - Cool down: cannot inspire again for three actions after ending (0.5)
  - **Cost:** 120/(1+0.5+0.5+0.5+0.5) = 120/3 = 40 CP

  - With same advantages and limitations as above
  - **Cost:** 90/3 = 30 CP

##### Protection Chant (Defensive Inspiration)

- **Improve Defense only:** 3d6 (45 CP raw strength)
  - With same advantages and limitations as above
  - **Cost:** 90/3 = 30 CP

### Thief Abilities

#### Lock Picking

- **Security/Hacking:** 3d6 (9 CP)
  - Specificity: Lock picking (mechanical locks)

When using this skill, the character rolls against the difficulty set by the lock creator's skill roll. Specificity rules apply:

- If trying to pick a medieval lock with this skill, there's no penalty
- If trying to pick a modern electronic lock, there would be incompatible specificity penalties
- If the character had taken a more general "Security/Hacking" without the lock picking specificity, they'd take a -1 penalty

### Fantasy Species

Fantasy species in Plasticine are primarily represented through the Problems mechanic, focusing on social aspects rather than inherent bonuses:

#### Species as Social Problems

**Problem: People assume species stereotype - [Species] (5 CP)**

- This represents the mild social challenges of being a non-human in many settings
- Could be upgraded to common (10 CP) in areas where that species faces frequent prejudice
- Could be upgraded to severe (10 CP) in areas with historical conflicts

#### Minimal Mechanical Elements

Species-specific abilities can be represented through themed limitations on powers:

**Dwarves:**

- Defensive abilities with the limitation "Only underground" (0.5)
- Resistance to Body reduction with the limitation "Only against poisons" (0.5)

**Elves:**

- Perception abilities with the limitation "Only in natural settings" (0.5)
- Movement abilities with the limitation "Only through forests" (0.5)

**Halflings:**

- Evasion abilities with the limitation "Only when outnumbered" (0.5)
- Improved ACT with the limitation "Only when unnoticed" (0.5)

### Campaign Guidelines

When creating a fantasy campaign using Plasticine, consider the following:

#### Character Point Allocation

- For low-fantasy "gritty" campaigns: 30-50 CP
- For heroic fantasy campaigns: 50-80 CP
- For high-fantasy/epic campaigns: 80-120 CP

#### Base Package

Consider providing a standard base package for all characters that includes:

- 2d6 in all four attributes
- Basic communication skills
- Basic movement abilities

#### Power Scale

- Determine the maximum raw strength allowed for powers (recommended: 80-100 CP for heroic fantasy)
- Set limitations on how many dice can be allocated to a single attribute/skill/power

#### Magic Integration

- Decide how common magic is in your setting
- Determine whether all characters have access to magic or if it's restricted to certain character concepts
- Consider creating "schools" of magic using the system advantage

By adapting these elements to your specific campaign world, you can create a fantasy experience that captures the essence of the genre while maintaining the flexible and mechanics-focused approach of the Plasticine system.

## Best Practices

### What Is a Tabletop Role-Playing Game?

A tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) is a collaborative storytelling experience where players create and control characters in an imaginary world. Unlike board games or video games, TTRPGs have no winners or losers—the goal is to create an engaging story together.

The basic components of a TTRPG include:

- **Game Master (GM):** The person who creates and controls the world, describes environments, plays non-player characters, and adjudicates rules.

- **Players:** Everyone else at the table, each controlling a player character (PC) who is a protagonist in the story.

- **Character Sheets:** Documents detailing each character's abilities, skills, and traits.

- **Rules:** The system that determines how actions are resolved when outcomes are uncertain.

- **Dice (or other randomizers):** Used to introduce an element of chance and unpredictability.

The typical flow of play is:

1. The GM describes a situation
2. Players describe what their characters do
3. When the outcome is uncertain, dice are rolled
4. The GM narrates the results
5. Repeat

What makes TTRPGs unique is their unlimited flexibility. Unlike video games where options are programmed, or board games with fixed rules, TTRPGs allow players to attempt anything they can imagine. The world exists in the shared imagination of everyone at the table.

People play TTRPGs for many reasons: to experience stories they help create, to solve problems creatively, to temporarily become someone else, and to share memorable moments with friends.

### For Game Masters

#### Session Zero

Before starting a campaign, run a "Session Zero". This foundational meeting establishes:

- Campaign tone and themes
- Player expectations
- Character creation guidelines
- Lines and veils (content boundaries)
- Scheduling and logistics

A proper Session Zero prevents misaligned expectations and helps build a cohesive group. Think of it as architectural planning before construction begins—skipping this step often leads to structural problems later.

#### Narrative Flow

##### The Rule of Cool

When a player attempts something creative that isn't explicitly covered by the rules, consider allowing it if:

- It would be entertaining for everyone
- It doesn't break the game's internal logic
- It doesn't overshadow other players' abilities

The rules exist to facilitate fun, not restrict it.

##### Yes, And...

When players suggest ideas, try to build on them rather than immediately blocking them. "Yes, and..." keeps narrative momentum while still maintaining your control over the game world.

For example:

Player: "Is there a chandelier I could swing from?"
GM: "Yes, and it looks rather unstable—might collapse when you're halfway across."

##### Failing Forward

Failed dice rolls shouldn't stop the game's momentum. Instead, they should create interesting complications.

- A failed lockpicking attempt doesn't mean "the door stays locked"
- It means "you unlock it, but trigger a silent alarm"
- Or "you break your tools, and now guards are approaching"

#### Pacing

Good pacing is essential to enjoyable sessions. Think of it like a heart's rhythm—periods of intensity followed by recovery, never staying too long in either state.

- Start sessions with action or intrigue
- End sessions on unresolved tension when possible
- Alternate between combat, exploration, and social interaction
- Watch for player engagement and shift gears when attention wanes

#### Preparation vs. Improvisation

Many GMs over-prepare and then feel frustrated when players ignore their content. The solution isn't more preparation, but better preparation.

- Prepare situations, not plots
- Create motivations for NPCs, not scripts
- Develop flexible encounters that can occur anywhere
- Build a toolbox of names, locations, and concepts to draw from

Remember: no preparation survives contact with the players.

#### Rules Management

##### When to Look Up Rules

Rules discussions can disrupt game flow. Use this guideline:

- If finding the rule takes less than 30 seconds, look it up
- If it would take longer, make a reasonable ruling and check later
- Document your rulings for consistency

##### House Rules

When modifying rules:

- Write down all house rules and share them with players
- Be consistent in their application
- Be willing to revise them if they aren't working
- Avoid changing rules mid-session unless absolutely necessary

##### The Meta-Rule: What Serves the Game?

When in doubt about a ruling, ask yourself: "Which choice would make a better game experience?"

This doesn't always mean ruling in the players' favor—challenges create meaningful stories. It means choosing the option that creates the most interesting and enjoyable ongoing narrative.

#### Managing Spotlight

Each player should have opportunities to shine. Some players naturally command attention, while others need encouragement.

- Directly address quiet players: "What does [character] think about this?"
- Create scenarios that highlight different character skills
- Notice when a player hasn't spoken in a while and bring them in
- Design challenges that require multiple approaches to solve

### For Players

#### Character Creation

##### Beyond the Character Sheet

Your character is more than a collection of statistics. Consider:

- What does your character want?
- What do they fear?
- How do they change over time?
- What relationships do they have with other characters?

Characters with motivations and flaws create more interesting stories than those optimized purely for mechanical effectiveness.

##### Team Compatibility

Create characters that have reasons to work with the group. The lone wolf who distrusts everyone might seem interesting in concept, but often creates frustration in practice.

Ask yourself:

- Why does my character stay with this group?
- What do they contribute to the team?
- How do they form bonds with other characters?

#### Playing Your Character

##### Engaging with the World

Active players create better games:

- Ask questions about the environment
- Interact with NPCs
- Form and pursue goals
- Take risks and make interesting choices

When your character enters a new location, how do they engage with it? What draws their attention? How do they move through the space?

##### Separating Player and Character Knowledge

Your character doesn't know everything you know. Sometimes the most interesting choice is not the optimal one, but the one your character would make based on their understanding and values.

##### Spotlight Sharing

Be aware of other players at the table:

- Avoid monopolizing game time
- Support other characters' moments
- Find ways to involve quieter players
- React to others' actions and decisions

#### Table Etiquette

##### Active Listening

When the GM or another player is speaking:

- Pay attention
- Avoid side conversations
- Put down your phone
- Take notes on important information

##### Managing Expectations

No game will perfectly match your ideal vision. The GM has prepared a world, but it may not contain everything you imagined. Adapt, compromise, and find joy in the unexpected.

##### Constructive Feedback

If something isn't working for you:

- Address it privately with the GM
- Frame concerns constructively
- Suggest alternatives
- Be willing to compromise

Saying "I'm not enjoying the puzzle-heavy sessions" is more helpful than "These puzzles are boring."

### For Everyone

#### The Social Contract

Role-playing games are fundamentally social experiences. The unwritten contract between everyone at the table includes:

- Respecting each other's time and contributions
- Communicating openly about preferences and boundaries
- Sharing responsibility for the group's enjoyment
- Being reliable about attendance and preparation

#### Safety Tools

Every table should have mechanisms for addressing uncomfortable content. These might include:

- **The X-Card:** A card that anyone can tap to signal discomfort
- **Lines and Veils:** Pre-established boundaries about content
- **Script Change:** Tools for pausing, rewinding, or fast-forwarding through scenes
- **Regular check-ins:** Brief discussions about how everyone is feeling about the game

These enable more creative exploration by establishing clear boundaries.

#### Conflict Resolution

Disagreements will arise. The healthiest groups:

- Address conflicts promptly
- Separate the person from the problem
- Focus on interests, not positions
- Generate multiple solutions
- Use objective criteria for decisions

Never let in-game conflicts create out-of-game tensions. Characters may fight; players should not.

#### Challenge Conventional Wisdom

##### Railroading Isn't Always Bad

The term "railroading"—forcing players along a predetermined story path—is universally condemned. Yet structured narratives can create memorable experiences as long as players have agency within those structures.

Consider:

- Players often enjoy well-crafted stories with clear direction
- Having some rails helps new players learn the game
- A completely open world can feel directionless and arbitrary
- Even the most acclaimed video games often have linear main quests

The key is transparency. If players know they're on a defined path for a specific story purpose, many will happily ride those rails to an exciting destination.

##### Perfect Balance Is Overrated

Game designers strive for perfect balance, but perfect balance can be perfectly boring. Some of the most memorable game moments come from imbalance:

- The underpowered character who saves the day through creativity
- The temporarily overpowered ability that creates a spectacular scene
- The unexpected combination that changes the game state dramatically

Balance matters for long-term play, but don't sacrifice memorable moments on the altar of perfect equilibrium.

##### Rules Should Sometimes Be Broken

Rules provide necessary structure, but sometimes the most interesting choice is to break them deliberately.

As a GM, consider occasionally:

- Fudging dice rolls for dramatic effect
- Ignoring certain mechanics for narrative payoff
- Creating special exceptions to rules for unique situations

As a player, ask:

- Could this moment be more interesting than strictly accurate?
- Would bending a rule create a better story?
- Am I putting fun and creativity above technical adherence?

The goal isn't anarchy, but thoughtful consideration of when the spirit of the game might override its letter.

#### Final Thoughts

Remember that tabletop RPGs are collaborative storytelling. Neither the GM nor any player has absolute authority over the narrative. The best games emerge from mutual creation and shared responsibility for everyone's enjoyment.

When in doubt, discuss issues openly, make decisions together, and always prioritize the human connections at your table above any game system or rule.

## The Plasticine Design Philosophy

### Core Principle

**Plasticine optimizes for verisimilitude to action/adventure narratives to enable collaborative storytelling.**

Every design choice stems from this single motto. When you understand this principle, the entire system becomes transparent - each seemingly unusual choice reveals itself as a logical consequence of this optimization target.

### What Does This Mean?

#### Verisimilitude, Not Simulation

Plasticine doesn't try to accurately simulate reality. It tries to recreate the *feel* of action/adventure stories:

**In action/adventure stories:** Protagonists survive multiple dangerous encounters with recoverable injuries  
**Plasticine:** Body is fixed at 30 for everyone; damage heals between sessions  
**Reality:** Bullet wounds cause organ damage, infection, permanent disability

**In action/adventure stories:** A skilled archer can make impossible shots that matter  
**Plasticine:** High ACC with "only with bow" limitation creates affordable excellence  
**Reality:** Physics, wind, target movement create complex variables

The question isn't "what would really happen?" It's "what happens in stories like this?"

#### Action/Adventure Specifically

This isn't "genre literature" - it's about narrative structure. Plasticine works for:

- NCIS (contemporary crime investigation)
- Stargate (science fiction exploration)
- The Hunger Games (dystopian survival)
- John Wick (action thriller)
- Dark Elf Saga (high fantasy)

It doesn't work for:

- Stranger in a Strange Land (philosophical sci-fi where pivotal moments are ideological)
- Interview with a Vampire (gothic horror where social intrigue and existential dread drive the story)
- Sex and the City (social drama where relationships and status determine outcomes)
- Misery (psychological horror resolved through mental fortitude, not combat capability)

**The defining characteristic:** Does your story resolve critical uncertainties through physical capability under pressure? Plasticine models that. If your story's pivotal moments revolve around different questions, you need a different system.

#### Collaborative Storytelling

Plasticine ruthlessly eliminates everything that doesn't serve collaborative storytelling:

- **No trap options:** Cost reflects value aggressively
- **Background is free:** Narrative choices don't compete with mechanical effectiveness
- **Abstract powers:** Special effects serve story without creating balance concerns
- **Minimal stats:** Fast adjudication maintains narrative momentum
- **No class restrictions:** Build any concept that serves your story

The system trusts players and GMs to handle non-action moments through roleplay, providing clean mechanics only for sequences that need adjudication.

### Design Principles in Practice

#### Reverse Engineering Characters

Plasticine was designed to let you reverse-engineer action/adventure protagonists into game statistics.
Traditional systems force you to invent numbers for things the author never cared about. Plasticine lets you model exactly what you see in action sequences.

#### The Character Creation Process

Because Plasticine models story beats, character creation must be narrative-first:

1. **Who is this character?** (Background - free)
2. **What problems do they face?** (Problems - gain CP)
3. **How do they move through action sequences?** (Attributes, Powers)
4. **What are they good at?** (Skills)

If you can't visualize your character in an action scene - can't "watch" them act - you're not ready to assign statistics. The stats are *translations* of what you see them doing, not building blocks you assemble into competence.

This is why Background comes first in the manual. It's not flavor text after the mechanics - it's the foundation. Everything else models how that character operates in the scenarios Plasticine adjudicates.

#### Cost Equals Value

The goal is simple: **if you're asked to give up 5 CP, you should be roughly agnostic about which ones you would sacrifice.**

This means:
- 5 CP of Background skills ≈ 5 CP of ACC ≈ 5 CP of powers ≈ 5 CP from a Problem
- They serve different story purposes but contribute equivalent value to collaborative storytelling
- No "must-have" purchases that tax every build
- No "trap" options that waste points
- Character sheets reflect genuine concept priorities

When different characters can allocate CP wildly differently and remain similarly effective, you know the system is working. The fungibility of CP is the goal.

#### Ruthless Simplification

Every design choice asks: "Does this serve collaborative storytelling in action/adventure contexts?"

**If yes:** Keep it, make it clear, make it functional  
**If no:** Remove it, regardless of tradition or expectation

##### Attributes: Only What Matters for Action Sequences

Traditional systems have 6+ attributes (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA) inherited from wargaming and early RPG design. Plasticine has four:

- **ACT:** How often you act in action sequences
- **ACC:** How likely you are to successfully target something
- **DEF:** How likely you are to avoid being targeted
- **PER:** How likely you are to notice important things

Why these four? Because these are what action/adventure stories actually adjudicate:

- Can you act before the other person?
- Can you hit your target?
- Can you avoid being hit?
- Do you notice the clue/trap/ambush?

Everything else is either:
- **Background** (being smart, charismatic, strong enough for daily life)
- **Skills** (specific competencies)
- **Powers** (exceptional capabilities)

**Example: Strength**

Traditional systems make STR an attribute because of wargaming legacy and dungeon-crawling logistics (carrying capacity, forcing doors). But authors don't naturally make it central to action storytelling.

In Plasticine:
- Carrying reasonable equipment? Background (free)
- Carrying enormous loads? Buy Push power
- Breaking down doors? Reduce the door's structural integrity
- Wrestling someone? Reduce their Move power

The capability exists when narratively relevant, purchased at cost proportional to action sequence value. No forced attribute that creates correlation ("strong people can carry AND punch hard AND break things").

##### Powers: Effects, Not Special Effects

HERO System's revolutionary insight was "separate game effects from special effects." Plasticine asks: why stop halfway?

**HERO has separate powers for:**
- Energy Blast (reduce STUN/BODY using physical defense)
- EGO Blast (reduce STUN/BODY using ego defense)
- Drain (temporarily reduce characteristic)
- Transfer (reduce one thing, increase another)

**But these are all variations of "reduce attribute" with different targeting.**

**Plasticine has one power: Adjust Attribute**
- Reduce or improve any attribute/skill/power
- Use modifiers for range, area, resistance type
- Special effects explain the narrative ("lightning bolt" vs "punch")

The same principle applies throughout:

- **Movement:** One power, limitations define how (flight, running, swimming, teleportation)
- **Detection:** One power, modifiers define what and how far
- **All "hiding" effects:** Reduce PER with different limitations
  - Invisibility: Reduce PER, only against sight
  - Disguise: Reduce PER, only against recognition
  - Stealth: Reduce PER, only against detection
  - Camouflage: Reduce PER, only to avoid notice

Special effects (fire vs. ice, technology vs. magic, mental vs. physical) don't need separate mechanical systems. They're narrative flavor on the same underlying operation.

##### Skills: No Middleman Stats

Traditional systems create forced correlations through attributes:

**D&D Style:**
- Buy DEX (expensive)
- Get bonus to Stealth, Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, Initiative
- Creates forced correlation: dexterous people are stealthy AND acrobatic AND quick

**Reality in stories:**
- A cat burglar might be stealthy but not acrobatic
- A gymnast might be acrobatic but not stealthy
- A gunslinger might be quick but neither stealthy nor acrobatic

**Plasticine:** Buy the skills you want. They cost what they're worth. No intermediate attribute creating forced correlations or optimization puzzles.

The same logic applies to social skills (no CHA), knowledge skills (no INT), and awareness (PER is bought directly, not derived from WIS).

#### Limitations: Judgment Over Tables

HERO has pages of specific limitations with precise values:
- "Costs Endurance (-1/4)"
- "Extra Time: 1 Turn (-3/4)"
- "Requires Skill Roll (-1/4 to -1/2)"
- Dozens more...

Then adds: "For limitations not listed, the GM should assign appropriate values."

All that enumeration doesn't eliminate judgment - you need it anyway. The lists just create overhead and false precision.

**Plasticine uses three buckets:**
- **0.25:** Barely limiting (minor inconvenience)
- **0.5:** Severely limiting (significant constraint on usage)
- **1.0:** Extremely limiting (rarely available)

With examples and principles to calibrate judgment. 

##### Special Cases Are Still Special Effects

"I have five powers sharing one mana pool" - is that more limiting than five independent powers? Yes. How much more? Probably 0.75-1.0 depending on details.

HERO creates entire subsystems (END/REC pool) with special pricing formulas and framework mechanics.

Plasticine: Multiple powers with shared constraints? That's more limiting than independent. Estimate 0.75-1.0.

The narrative explanation (they're all fire powers! one device! reconfigurable energy!) doesn't need mechanical frameworks. It's special effect.

#### Hard to Game

Complex pricing systems create optimization opportunities:

**System Mastery in Traditional Games:**
- Finding undercosted feat combinations
- Exploiting specific rule interactions
- "Coffee-locks," "hexblade dips," slot economy optimization
- Trap options to avoid vs. must-haves to take

**Plasticine's Approach:**
- Cost ≈ story usefulness
- Simple enough that value is transparent
- Hard to exploit because there's no hidden complexity
- Judgment-based limitations prevent "finding the loophole"

Players optimize toward "interesting character who does cool things" rather than "exploit the mechanical interaction that gives 3x effectiveness per CP."

### What This Means for Different Genres

#### Why not Sex in the City

**Sex and the City pivotal moments:**
- Does your conversation charm or alienate?
- Does your outfit make the right impression?
- Can you navigate the social hierarchy?
- Do you say the right thing at the critical moment?

Carrie boxes at the gym. But the *uncertainties being adjudicated* are completely different.

Even if Carrie throws a punch (thinks she's being mugged, hits her love interest), the scene isn't resolved by "how much Body damage?" It's resolved by: Does this create attraction? How embarrassing is this? Can the relationship recover?

#### Why not Horror?

Horrow asks: can you learn what's happening without going mad? Can you maintain sanity when faced with the incomprehensible? Can you find the information before it's too late?

If you need to fire a gun in horror, you've already lost. The pivotal moments are:
- Research and investigation (primary "powers")
- Sanity checks (primary resource being depleted)
- Understanding what you face
- Maintaining mental coherence

Even in psychological horror like *Misery*, the resolution isn't ACC vs DEF. It's "can Paul maintain enough mental fortitude and deception to survive?"
The final physical confrontation is narrative consequence of psychological endurance, not combat adjudication.

**The system models what creates tension in the genre's structure, not what literally happens.**

### Common Design Questions Answered

#### "Why is immortality 0 CP?"

During action sequences, immortal and mortal characters function identically:
- Both roll DEF when targeted
- Both take Body damage when hit
- Both fall unconscious at Body 0

Immortality affects narrative consequences *after* the action sequence (character might revive later), but doesn't change action sequence mechanics. By Plasticine's optimization target, it's equivalent to having blue eyes - narrative color without mechanical weight.

In a different genre where resurrection is the pivotal uncertainty, immortality would cost CP. In action/adventure, it's background.

#### "Why can't you buy Body above 30?"

Action/adventure verisimilitude requires:
- Protagonists can survive multiple encounters
- But face real danger from competent opposition
- Individual fights have stakes

If Body scales with CP, high-CP characters become unkillable by anything except cosmic threats. This breaks the genre feel where skilled opponents remain dangerous.

Fixed Body means a knife can still kill anyone - but skill (DEF) determines whether it connects. This maintains genre-appropriate tension throughout character advancement.

#### "Why are there so few attributes?"

Because these are what action/adventure stories actually adjudicate. More attributes either:
- Create forced correlations that don't match story patterns
- Model things that should be skills/powers/background
- Add complexity without increasing story contribution

Traditional RPGs tried to model "complete humans." Plasticine models "what matters for the stories we're telling."

#### "Why are Background skills so cheap?"

A character with Background: Medieval History might:
- Recognize the historical significance of a location
- Know which noble houses have feuds
- Understand castle architecture for tactical advantage
- Provide narrative hooks and roleplay moments

This contributes to the story without being combat-decisive. The cheap cost (1D/1CP) reflects appropriate value.

#### "What about character optimization?"

The goal isn't to eliminate optimization - it's to align optimization with story quality.

**Bad optimization:** "I found the mechanical loophole that gives me double effectiveness for the same CP"

**Good optimization:** "I allocated my CP to create exactly the character concept I want, and it's as effective as other characters with different concepts"

When cost equals value and trap options don't exist, optimization becomes "what do I want my character to do?" rather than system mastery.

#### "How do you handle equipment?"

Equipment used regularly, or matters to the story, should be bought as powers (with "requires item" limitation if appropriate).

**Examples:**

- **Daily-use gun:** Reduce Body power with "ranged" advantage and "requires gun" limitation
- **Signature sword:** Part of Reduce Body power with "requires specific weapon" limitation
- **Regular clothes, wallet, phone:** Background (free)
- **Vehicle used in missions:** Helper (vehicle)
- **Safe house for the team:** Helper (base)

The question is: does it have mechanical effect on action sequences? If yes, buy it. If no, it's background.

#### "What about magic vs. technology?"

They're special effects. A lightning bolt and a laser beam that both deal 3d6 ranged damage cost the same because they have identical mechanical effect on action sequences.

This enables:
- Any power level to include both magic and tech
- Genre-mixing without balance concerns
- Player creativity without optimization penalties

The balance comes from mechanics. The flavor comes from special effects. They're separate concerns.

### What Plasticine Doesn't Do

#### It's Not Universal

Plasticine explicitly optimizes for one thing: action/adventure collaborative storytelling. It doesn't try to:

- Model comprehensive reality
- Handle every possible genre
- Simulate social dynamics
- Adjudicate political intrigue
- Resolve philosophical questions
- Model economic systems

#### It's Not Simulationist

Plasticine doesn't model:

- Realistic wound healing
- Accurate ballistics
- Structural engineering
- Economic simulation
- Scientific accuracy

#### It Doesn't Eliminate Judgment

Plasticine embraces GM and player judgment as essential to collaborative storytelling:

- Limitation values require calibration
- Situational modifiers need assessment
- Story impact determines pricing

This is intentional. The system provides principles and examples to support good judgment, not pretend it can be eliminated through exhaustive rules.

### Why This Philosophy Matters

Plasticine isn't "first system optimized for action/adventure".

Plasticine's contribution:

1. **Explicit philosophy:** Design transparently optimized for one clear target
2. **Ruthless simplification:** HERO's philosophy pushed further, complexity cut aggressively
3. **Accessibility:** Simpler than HERO/GURPS while maintaining the core insights

### Conclusion

Every Plasticine design choice stems from one principle: **optimize for verisimilitude to action/adventure narratives to enable collaborative storytelling.**

When you understand this:

- Fixed Body makes sense (maintains genre-appropriate danger)
- Four attributes make sense (model what stories actually adjudicate)
- Abstract powers make sense (mechanical effect separate from narrative description)
- Free background makes sense (narrative choices don't compete with effectiveness)
- Simple limitations make sense (support judgment, avoid false precision)
- Cost equals value makes sense (eliminate traps, align optimization with concept)

The system doesn't try to be universal. It doesn't try to simulate reality. It doesn't try to serve every player preference.

It does one thing: provides clean mechanical adjudication for action/adventure storytelling while staying out of the way the rest of the time.

If that's what you want, Plasticine delivers it with uncommon clarity and purpose.

If you want something else - comprehensive simulation, social intrigue mechanics, horror investigation - you need a different system optimized for different goals.
