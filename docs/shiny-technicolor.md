# Shiny Technicolor Rangers Campaign Guide

## Campaign Overview

### The World of Shinies

Super-powered people are called "shinies". The existence of shinies, among most people, is akin to "sasquatch"-style rumors. People are familiar with the rumors, but most people do not believe them. Shinies, for their part, are committed to keeping the existence of powers a secret.

There are two kinds of shinies: "purples" and "yellows". Player characters are all purples.

There is no difference in powers or power levels between purples and yellows. However, the two cannot get along: there is an innate psychological aversion between them. Some shinies treat the aversion as an unfortunate issue. However, it is more common for shinies to rationalize the aversion and treat it as a moral difference.

### Look and Feel

Shinies are so-called because when their powers are activated, they glow faintly but clearly with their colors. This glow is strong enough to obscure facial features, but not general body shape or type.

In general, people develop the "shine" in puberty. Usually, a kind-hearted shiny of the same color will find them and mentor them through the initial development.

Although all characters are shiny, they are not all the same, and they do *not* have the same powers. Almost any kind of character can be built with the justification of "shiny".

**Examples:**

- A typical "tank" can be built with the justification that activating the shine increases mass, strength, and skin density.
- A speedster can be built with the justification that activating the shine increases their speed.
- A supermage can be built with the justification that activating the shine gives them access to various spells.

### Adventures

The shinies are concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area. It is not known if shinies exist anywhere else.

The characters struggle with three kinds of challenges:

1. **Non-super-powered emergencies:** Crimes or emergencies they encounter, either because of proximity or because regular first responders are overwhelmed.

2. **Yellow encounters:** Encounters with yellows often escalate. Whether a yellow shiny is doing something nefarious, using powers for some reason, or even responding to the same emergency, things will escalate.

3. **Self-policing purple issues:** If a purple shiny uses their powers for nefarious purposes, other purple shinies will try to deal with it before it gets out of control. Yellows trying to "help" will often just escalate the problem, while regular law-enforcement first responders are ill-equipped to deal with the issue (and might threaten the secrecy).

## Character Creation for Shiny Technicolor

### Power Level

This is a superhero campaign. Characters are built with:

- **Total CP:** 100
- **CP from Problems:** 20-30 (required range)
- **Base package:** Standard human baseline (included in the 100 CP)

### Starting with Your Concept

Start with a high-level concept. The concept is usually made of two parts that should intersect:

- **Secret Identity**
- **Archetype**

The secret identity concept should include at least gender, age, and profession.

For archetype, you can draw inspiration from existing supers. Here is a short list:

**Avengers:**
- Natasha: Martial artist
- Hulk: Brick
- Thor: Weapon Master
- Dr. Strange: Mystic
- Hawkeye: Energy projector
- Ant-Man: Metamorph

**Justice League:**
- Flash: Speedster
- Martian Manhunter: Mentalist

### Problems

It's often easier (counterintuitively) to start with the Problems. Choose Problems until you reach the 20-30 CP range. This gives you extra character points while defining your character's struggles and complications.

**Campaign-Specific Problem:**

All purple shinies have an innate aversion to yellow shinies. This should be taken as:

- **Problem: Psychological aversion to yellow shinies (Common, Severe)** - 10 CP

This is required for all characters and counts toward your 20-30 CP problem requirement.

**Other Problem Ideas:**

Consider the [Master List of Complications Wiki](https://masterlistsofcomplications.fandom.com/wiki/The_Master_List_of_Complications_Wiki) for inspiration, but remember to frame them in Plasticine terms:

- Secret identity complications (Social)
- Dependents who need protection (Social)
- Psychological limitations (Internal)
- Physical vulnerabilities tied to powers (Mechanics)
- Hunted by government agencies (Social, possibly Common)
- Powers malfunction under specific conditions (Mechanics)

### Background

Now that you know what your character is in civilian life, what kind of super they are, and what their problems are, write a few paragraphs of prose describing:

- Who are your character's friends? Rivals?
- When did your character discover their powers?
- What is their main motivation?
- How do they balance their civilian life with their shiny activities?

### Civilian Identity

Allocate 10-20 CP to make sure your character's civilian identity is reasonably competent. This typically includes:

- **Background skills:** 2-3 areas of professional or academic expertise (3-6 CP each)
- **Unopposed skills:** Specific capabilities like Systems Operation or Communication
- **Opposed skills:** Perhaps Security/Hacking or other relevant skills

**Examples:**

- A journalist might have: Background: Journalism (3d6), Communication: Written (3d6), Systems: Computer research (3d6)
- A doctor might have: Background: Medicine (4d6), Background: Biology (3d6), Communication: Bedside manner (3d6)
- A mechanic might have: Background: Automotive engineering (3d6), Systems: Vehicle operation (3d6), Security/Hacking: Mechanical locks (2d6)

### Attributes

Recommend buying all four attributes to at least 3d6 (9 CP each). For a superhero campaign, consider going higher:

- **ACT (3 CP/pip):** How often you act in combat. 3d6 (27 CP) is baseline, 4d6 (39 CP) makes you notably faster
- **ACC (1 CP/pip):** Your ability to hit targets. 3d6-4d6 (9-12 CP) is typical
- **DEF (1 CP/pip):** Your ability to avoid being hit. 3d6-4d6 (9-12 CP) is typical  
- **PER (1 CP/pip):** Your ability to notice things. 3d6 (9 CP) is usually sufficient

### Combat Readiness

Superheroes face dangerous situations. Your character should have reasonable ways to respond. Consider:

**How does your character incapacitate opponents?**

Most characters will want at least one offensive power:

- **Reduce Body:** The standard attack power
  - Basic melee: 3d6 (45 CP), with limitations like "requires martial arts skill roll" (0.5) = 30 CP
  - Basic ranged: 2d6 (30 CP), ranged 30m (×6) = 180 CP, with limitations like "requires weapon" (0.5), "requires ammunition" (0.25) = 180/1.75 ≈ 103 CP

For a superhero, you might want something more impressive:

- **Energy projection:** 4d6 (60 CP), ranged 50m (×9) = 540 CP, with limitations like "gestures" (0.5), "visible attack" (0.25), "extra time: 1 action to charge" (0.5) = 540/2.25 ≈ 240 CP... which is too expensive!

This is where the Variant system helps. Buy your most expensive attack, then buy variants at reduced cost:

- **Primary attack:** 4d6 ranged (50m) with specific limitations = 240 CP
- **Melee variant:** Same power at touch range (much cheaper) = 24 CP (10% of 240)
- **Area effect variant:** 3d6, ranged 20m, AoE 3m radius = 24 CP (10% of primary, as long as total cost doesn't exceed primary)

**How does your character avoid being incapacitated?**

Options include:

- **High Defense attribute:** 4d6 or more
- **Resistance to Body adjustment:** Protects against damage (5 CP raw strength per pip of resistance)
- **Mobility:** High Move power to stay out of range
- **Defensive powers:** Reduce Accuracy against self, improve own Defense

### "Color" Powers

Spend at least 10 CP on a "color" power that sets your character apart from other archetypes. This is something distinctive that makes your character unique and interesting beyond "I hit things" or "I defend."

**Examples:**

- **Wall-crawling:** Move 5m (1 CP), with advantages: Ignore intervening obstacles (×2) = 2 CP, with limitation "only on solid surfaces" (0.5) = 1.3 CP
- **Danger sense:** Detect: Imminent danger 3d6 (9 CP), limited to physical threats (0.5), only within 10m (0.5) = 4.5 CP
- **Charismatic aura:** Improve others' Communication skill, 2d6 (12 CP), AoE 5m (×3) = 36 CP, with limitations "only when inspiring/leading" (0.5), "requires concentration" (0.5), "cannot affect self" (0.5) = 36/2.5 ≈ 14 CP
- **Perfect balance:** Unopposed Skill: Acrobatics to 6d6 (18 CP) with limitation "only for balance-related tasks" (0.5) = 12 CP

### The Shine Effect

All characters should buy their purple shine glow as:

- **Signal: Visible light, 1d6 (3 CP)** with limitations:
  - Only when powers are active (1.0)
  - Obscures facial features but reveals location (0.5)
  - Cannot be suppressed (0.5)
  
Cost: 3/(1+1.0+0.5+0.5) = 3/3 = 1 CP

This mechanical representation reflects that the glow is constant when using powers, makes you visible, but protects your identity.

### Overall Balance

Once you have a rough draft, check your character for balance:

- **Overpowered:** Can it shrug off attacks by equivalent characters? If your DEF + Resistance makes you nearly unhittable and invulnerable, you might be too strong.

- **Underpowered:** Can you be knocked out by a single easy attack? With Body 30, a 4d6 attack (average 14 damage) should be survivable but threatening. If you have no defense or resistance, you might be too vulnerable.

- **Boring in superhero persona:** Is it "just another brick/blaster/speedster"? Do you have at least one distinctive color power? Can all your attacks be avoided with one cool trick?

- **Boring in secret identity:** Does your character have some fun hobbies, relationships, or civilian skills that matter? Have you invested at least 10 CP in civilian capabilities?

### Building Powers for This Campaign

#### Standard Power Packages

Here are some pre-built power packages for common archetypes, adapted for the Shiny Technicolor campaign:

#### Brick (Tank)

**Concept:** When you activate your shine, your mass, strength, and skin density dramatically increase.

- **Primary Attack:** Reduce Body 5d6 (75 CP)
  - Limitations: Hand-to-hand only (0.5), requires high mass form (0.25)
  - Cost: 75/1.75 ≈ 43 CP

- **Resistance:** Resist Body reduction 4d6 (60 CP raw strength)
  - Limitations: Only when in high mass form (0.5), reduced mobility when active (0.25)
  - Cost: 60/1.75 ≈ 34 CP

- **Attributes:** ACT 3d6 (27 CP), ACC 3d6 (9 CP), DEF 3d6 (9 CP), PER 3d6 (9 CP)

**Total: 43 + 34 + 54 = 131 CP** (need to reduce or add more limitations)

#### Speedster

**Concept:** Your shine dramatically increases your speed and reaction time.

- **Movement:** Move 30m (6 CP)
  - Advantages: None needed
  - Limitations: Speed inertia (can change speed 10m/round) (0.25), requires open space (0.25)
  - Cost: 6/1.5 = 4 CP

- **Improved ACT:** Improve ACT 3d6 (45 CP)
  - Limitations: Self only (0.5), constant drain (requires active maintenance) (0.5)
  - Cost: 45/2 ≈ 23 CP

- **Quick Strikes:** Reduce Body 3d6 (45 CP)
  - Advantages: Can attack multiple times per round
  - Limitations: Hand-to-hand only (0.5), requires high ACT to use effectively (0.25)
  - Cost: 45/1.75 ≈ 26 CP

- **Attributes:** ACT 4d6 (39 CP), ACC 4d6 (12 CP), DEF 4d6 (12 CP), PER 3d6 (9 CP)

**Total: 4 + 23 + 26 + 72 = 125 CP** (reasonable with some civilian skills cut)

#### Energy Projector

**Concept:** Your shine allows you to project energy blasts.

**Energy Blast:** Reduce Body 4d6 (60 CP)
  - Advantages: Ranged 40m (×7) = 420 CP
  - Limitations: Gestures (0.5), verbal component (0.5), visible attack (0.25), requires concentration (0.5)
  - Cost: 420/2.75 ≈ 153 CP

This is too expensive! Use the Variant system:

- **Primary blast:** 4d6, ranged 40m, with above limitations = 153 CP (leave 1 limitation slot flexible)
  - Cost with Flexible Advantage (can use any combination of advantages up to half cost): Still expensive

Alternative approach:

- **Energy Blast:** Reduce Body 3d6 (45 CP)
  - Advantages: Ranged 30m (×6) = 270 CP
  - Limitations: Gestures (0.5), visible attack (0.25), requires aiming (0.25)
  - Cost: 270/2 = 135 CP

Still expensive but more reasonable. Add:

- **Variant: Rapid fire:** 2d6, ranged 30m, can hit multiple targets = 13.5 CP (10% of primary)
- **Variant: Overcharge:** 4d6, ranged 30m, extra time (2 actions) = 13.5 CP (10% of primary)

- **Attributes:** ACT 3d6 (27 CP), ACC 4d6 (12 CP), DEF 3d6 (9 CP), PER 3d6 (9 CP)

**Total: 135 + 13.5 + 13.5 + 57 = 219 CP** (still over budget!)

The solution is to either:
1. Accept fewer dice of damage
2. Add more limitations
3. Reduce range

Let's try: 2d6 ranged 20m with heavy limitations:

- **Energy Blast:** Reduce Body 2d6 (30 CP)
  - Advantages: Ranged 20m (×5) = 150 CP
  - Limitations: Gestures (0.5), verbal component (0.5), visible attack (0.25), extra time: 1 action to charge (0.5), cool down: exhausts for 3 actions after use (1.0)
  - Cost: 150/3.75 ≈ 40 CP

Now add variants at 10% cost (4 CP each):

- **Variant: Sustained beam:** Can maintain for multiple actions without cool down, but lower damage
- **Variant: Spread shot:** Area effect but even lower damage

**Total: 40 + 4 + 4 + 57 (attributes) + 10-20 (civilian) = 115-125 CP** (now reasonable!)

#### Mentalist

**Concept:** Your shine gives you telepathic abilities.

- **Telepathy Suite:**
  - Detect: Thoughts, 3d6 (9 CP)
    - Advantages: Range 20m (×5) = 45 CP
    - Limitations: Requires concentration (0.5), line of sight (0.5)
    - Cost: 45/2 ≈ 23 CP

  - Signal: Mental communication, 2d6 (6 CP)
    - Advantages: Range 20m (×5) = 30 CP, multiple recipients (×2) = 60 CP
    - Limitations: Requires concentration (0.5), line of sight (0.5), only willing recipients (0.5)
    - Cost: 60/2.5 = 24 CP

  - Mental Attack: Reduce Accuracy 3d6 (45 CP)
    - Advantages: Ranged 10m (×4) = 180 CP
    - Limitations: Use different resistance (vs. PER defense) (×2 after other mods), line of sight (0.5), requires concentration (0.5)
    - Cost: 180×2/2 = 180 CP (way too expensive!)

Reduce to: Reduce Accuracy 2d6, ranged 10m, heavy limitations:

- **Mental Attack:** Reduce Accuracy 2d6 (30 CP)
  - Advantages: Ranged 10m (×4) = 120 CP
  - Limitations: Line of sight (0.5), requires concentration (0.5), use PER resistance (0.5, since not as extreme as ×2), extra time: 2 actions (0.5), cool down: 3 actions (1.0)
  - Cost: 120/4 = 30 CP

- **Attributes:** ACT 3d6 (27 CP), ACC 3d6 (9 CP), DEF 4d6 (12 CP), PER 5d6 (15 CP) - mentalists need high PER

**Total: 23 + 24 + 30 + 63 = 140 CP** (high, but mentalists are expensive; may need to reduce or add limitations)

### Power Construction Guidelines

When building powers for this campaign:

1. **Start with effect:** What do you want to accomplish mechanically?

2. **Add advantages:** Range, area of effect, etc. This multiplies cost significantly.

3. **Add limitations:** These divide cost. For superhero campaigns, expect 1.5-3.0 total limitation value on major powers.

4. **Use Variant system:** Buy your most expensive version as primary, then other versions at 10% cost (as long as their total cost doesn't exceed the primary).

5. **Consider Flexible Advantage:** Pay double for a power with flexible advantages (can use any combination up to half the base cost). This is expensive but versatile.

**Total CP: 81 + 10 + 50 = 141 CP from base 100 + 20 from problems = 120 CP available**

(Need to reduce by 21 CP - could lower some attributes or skills)

### Campaign-Specific Rules

#### The Purple/Yellow Aversion

All purple shinies suffer from an innate psychological aversion to yellow shinies. Mechanically:

- When in the presence of a yellow shiny (within visual range), purples suffer -2 to all Communication skill rolls with that yellow
- Purples must succeed in a Difficult (16+) unopposed skill roll (using an appropriate Background or Communication skill) to cooperate peacefully with a yellow for more than a few minutes
- This aversion affects all purples equally, regardless of their other characteristics

#### Secrecy

The existence of shinies is a secret. Characters should be mindful of:

- Not using powers in front of witnesses when possible
- The purple glow obscures facial features but not body type or general appearance
- Regular law enforcement is not equipped to handle shiny conflicts
- Exposure risks both the individual shiny and all shinies

#### The Bay Area Setting

Adventures take place in the San Francisco Bay Area. Characters should be familiar with:

- Local geography (San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, etc.)
- Major landmarks and locations
- Transportation infrastructure
- Local culture and communities

The GM may provide bonuses for characters who invest in Bay Area geography or local knowledge skills.

### Advancement

Characters receive 2-4 CP per session, depending on:

- Successfully completing mission objectives
- Good roleplaying and character development
- Protecting the secret of shinies
- Dealing creatively with purple/yellow conflicts

### Final Notes

This campaign blends superhero action with secret identity drama. Your character should be:

- Competent in their civilian identity
- Effective in their shiny persona
- Interesting beyond just their combat abilities
- Connected to the Bay Area and other purples

Balance combat effectiveness with civilian capabilities and distinctive "color" powers that make your character memorable.
