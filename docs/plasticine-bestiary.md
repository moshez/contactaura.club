## Appendix: Building Custom Creatures

### General Guidelines

When creating your own creatures for Plasticine campaigns, follow these principles:

1. **CP Budget:** Determine threat level first, then allocate CP accordingly
2. **Focus on Action Sequences:** Buy powers that matter in combat/action scenes
3. **Background is Free:** Monster ecology, habitat, behavior patterns cost nothing
4. **Use Limitations:** Most monsters should have significant limitations on powers (requires specific forms of attack, specific environments, etc.)
5. **Keep It Simple:** Not every creature needs 10 powers. 2-4 well-chosen powers create memorable encounters

### Typical CP Allocation

For a balanced creature:
- 30-40% on Attributes (especially ACT, ACC, DEF)
- 40-50% on primary attack/defense Powers
- 10-20% on special abilities that make creature unique
- 10-20% on Skills

### Creating Threat

Threat doesn't just come from CP total. Consider:

- **Action Economy:** Multiple weak creatures can overwhelm high CP characters
- **Environmental Advantages:** Creatures fighting in home terrain should use battlefield
- **Special Abilities:** Unique powers create memorable encounters even at lower CP
- **Tactics:** Intelligent use of abilities multiplies effectiveness

### Thematic Consistency

Each creature should have:
- **Clear concept:** What is this creature in one sentence?
- **Signature ability:** What makes this creature unique and memorable?
- **Tactical niche:** How does it fight differently from other creatures?
- **Counterplay:** What can players do to gain advantage against it?

## GM Notes on Using This Bestiary

### Adjusting Difficulty

**To make creatures easier:**
- Reduce ACT (fewer actions)
- Reduce ACC (less likely to hit)
- Remove or weaken special abilities
- Reduce CP allocation to powers

**To make creatures harder:**
- Increase PER (harder to surprise)
- Add environmental advantages
- Give them numerical superiority
- Add special resistances or abilities
- Have them fight intelligently and coordinate

### Encounter Building

**Solo creature encounters:** Use creatures with CP equal to or higher than combined party CP
**Group encounters:** Use multiple creatures with combined CP equal to party CP
**Mixed encounters:** Combine one strong creature (60-80% party CP) with several weak ones

### Environmental Considerations

Many creatures become significantly more dangerous in appropriate environments:
- **Spike Roller** in confined corridors
- **Mirror Stalker** in halls of mirrors or polished temples
- **Razor Grass** in fields and meadows
- **Tar Hound** in darkness
- **Bellows Wyrm** in enclosed spaces where fire breath can't be avoided

### Making Combat Memorable

Use creatures' special abilities to create unique scenarios:
- **Cage Ribs** forces group to save trapped ally
- **Mirror Stalker** creates paranoia about reflections
- **Bellows Wyrm** provides clear telegraph (inhale) before devastating attack
- **Razor Grass** makes terrain itself dangerous

The best encounters combine creature abilities with environmental features and tactical situations to create problem-solving opportunities beyond "roll ACC vs DEF until someone falls down."
